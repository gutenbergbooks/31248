<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> his book, <i>Le D&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>, Zola shows in a
vivid and intelligible manner the downfall
of Napoleon III. and his army, and paints in
his usual matter-of-fact tints the actual condition
of the great host led forth to destruction.
He makes us read in the soul of the common
French soldier and in that of his commanding
officer. The keen analysis of the characters he
portrays enables us humanly to understand the
catastrophe on the plains of Sedan. The whole
Second Empire undermined by corruption; the
army, head and front, honeycombed with loose
morals, favoritism, and boundless conceit,&mdash;we
begin to perceive the main reasons underlying
the utter defeat of a gallant nation. And this
all the more when, side by side with the sombre
painting of Zola, we read the God-fearing letters
written home from the reeking battlefields
by William I. and his Iron Chancellor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, when the conquering German legions
returned, in the spring of 1871, to their own
firesides, they presented a body of men of whom
any nation might have been proud. Elated they
were at their unparalleled successes, but not
puffed-up or vainglorious.</p>

<p>A generation has passed since then. Is the
German army of to-day still of the same metal?
Does it, as a body, still show the same sterling
qualities which led it to victory after victory on
the soil of France?</p>

<p>Alas, no. On that point the best and clearest
minds in Germany itself are agreed. Foreign
military leaders who have had opportunity to
watch the German soldier of to-day at play and
at work, have sent home reports to their respective
governments, saying: &#8220;These are not the
men that won in 1870!&#8221;</p>

<p>A couple of years ago several American officers
of high rank, fresh from the Philippines,
witnessed the great autumn man&#339;uvres of the
German army, conducted under the supreme
command of William II. One of them, after
viewing in stark amazement the senseless attacks
of whole cavalry divisions up steep declivities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
or down slippery embankments, exposed all
the while to a withering fire from the rifles of
infantry masses, said to the present writer: &#8220;If
this were actual war, not a horse or man would
be left alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Reichstag, the national parliament of
Germany, many have been the heated debates
and scorching has been the bitter satire passed
during recent years upon the German army of
to-day. And not only the solid phalanx of
Socialists did the criticising on such occasions,
but also not a few members of every other
party, even including those of the Conservative
Faction, composed of men who are the very
representatives of the caste from which the
Empire&#8217;s corps of officers have sprung.</p>

<p>The German newspaper press has sounded of
late years, again and again, the note of alarm,
dwelling in scathing articles on signs of decadence
in the nation&#8217;s whilom pride,&mdash;the army.
It has pointed out the growing spirit of luxury
in its ranks, the wholesale abuse of power by
the officers and sergeants, the looseness of discipline,
the havoc wrought by &#8220;army usurers,&#8221;
the &#8220;money marriages,&#8221; so much in vogue with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
debt-ridden officers, the hard drinking and lax
morals prevailing, the gaming for high stakes,
which is another festering sore, and leads to
the ruin of so many,&mdash;and a whole train of
other evils. The professional, that is, the military,
press has joined in this chorus in more
subdued tones.</p>

<p>Throughout the length and breadth of the
Empire a spirit of disquiet, nay, of apprehension,
has spread. Are the very foundations
trembling on which the reunited &#8220;fatherland&#8221;
rests?</p>

<p>If any reliance can be placed on an unbroken
chain of evidence it would seem so indeed.</p>

<p>It was in 1786 that Frederick the Great died,
leaving an army that he had raised to the pinnacle
of fame. With this army he had faced
and vanquished, standing at bay against almost
the whole of continental Europe, his powerful
foes. Little Prussia, a straggling strip of territory
stretching from the ice-bound Niemen to
the vine-clad Rhine, Frederick&#8217;s genius had
lifted until it took rank with the powers that
prescribe laws to the world.</p>

<p>A score of years later, just one short score,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the hills of Jena looked down upon the crushing,
disgraceful defeat of this same Prussian
army. The country was dismembered, and as
a political force ceased to exist. The heel of
the Corsican despot was on its neck. Even
after the restoration of Prussia by the Vienna
Congress in 1815, it required another half-century
to give her back her lost prestige. Sadowa
and Sedan reinstated Prussia, and with her the
allied states of Germany in her former glory.</p>


<p class="thoughtbreak">Is another Jena coming?</p>

<p>Are we on the eve of another international
upheaval?</p>

<hr />

<p>A little book has recently appeared in Germany.
Its title is unpretentious. <i>Aus einer
kleinen Garnison</i> (&#8220;A Little Garrison&#8221;) does
not sound very sensational. The book, besides,
was written by a simple lieutenant, Bilse by
name. There was apparently nothing to arouse
public attention in its appearance.</p>

<p>And yet, from the instant of its publication,
this little book <i>did</i> arouse such attention; more
than that, it grew into an enormous sensational<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
event, and led to developments of such a serious
character that their consequences will be felt for
many years to come. Indeed it seems likely
that this little book will indirectly be the means
of the moral reformation of the entire German
army.</p>

<p>Shortly after its appearance the authorship of
Lieutenant Bilse, who had written under the
pen name of Fritz von der Kyrburg, was discovered.
A court-martial was promptly convened,
and he was summoned to appear before
this military tribunal.</p>

<p>Mail reports now to hand of this memorable
trial show that it created intense interest in
Germany, that it was regarded, indeed, as a
<i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of the first magnitude. The interest
in the case was largely due to the belief
that Lieutenant Bilse&#8217;s novel&mdash;for he had given
his terrible arraignment of the army the outward
semblance of a novel&mdash;presented a true,
if highly unflattering, picture of conditions as
they exist in many German garrison towns.
This impression was borne out by the evidence,
which tended to corroborate the account given
by Lieutenant Bilse of the moral tone and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
standard of discipline prevailing among the officers.
Part of the revelations have not been
made public, as the examination of some witnesses
was conducted <i>in camera</i>. It is understood
that their evidence was of a highly
sensational character.</p>

<p>In his examination, Lieutenant Bilse stated
that since entering the service he had &#8220;lost all
his illusions concerning the character and duties
of an officer&#8217;s calling.&#8221; He declared that the
social and regimental tone of the frontier garrison
towns was extremely low, and that the
repeated instances of lax discipline, favoritism,
and loose living which he had observed had
provoked him to write his book.</p>

<p>In not a single instance were the facts of
the various incidents and events which form,
grouped in a loose tissue, the body of his book
disproved or even weakened by the testimony
produced at the trial.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the court-martial sentenced the
young officer to six months&#8217; imprisonment and
to dismissal from the service &#8220;for libelling his
superior and commanding officers by the publication
of writings in a peculiarly offensive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
and damaging form, and also for a breach of
service regulations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant was undoubtedly guilty of a
breach of regulations, as an officer in Germany
is prohibited from publishing any printed matter
except over his true name, and is required to
give notice of his intention to the military
authorities,&mdash;a rule which the young man had
violated.</p>

<p>The German press, in its comments on the
case, admits that it has an importance far beyond
the person of the accused.</p>

<p>The Berlin <i>Post</i>, one of the chief organs of
the aristocracy in Germany, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In the interest of the army&#8217;s good name it is
urgently requisite that abuses such as have been
partly disclosed should be speedily and thoroughly
eradicated.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The Berlin <i>Tageblatt</i>, a leading paper, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Lieutenant Bilse&#8217;s book should be seriously pondered
in high places.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>, one of the oldest and
most respected journals at the German capital,
made this comment:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;That such things could be possible in German
military corps would have seemed impossible to the
most malevolent critic ... the public confidence
must be restored.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The Hamburg <i>Nachrichten</i>, Bismarck&#8217;s old
organ, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;We regret to admit that the picture is not
overdrawn.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>And that is the tenor of all the comment of
the entire German press. In the neighboring
countries, in the house of Germany&#8217;s friends,
Austria and Italy, the comment was even more
outspoken; while in France and Russia, although
their political affiliations are not precisely
friendly to Germany, more forbearance
was shown.</p>

<p>The Bilse book and the Bilse case have
since formed the theme of divers debates in
the Reichstag. On an interpellation from some
of the delegates, the Minister of War, General
von Einem, made some interesting admissions.
He did not deny that Bilse had stated, in the
guise of fiction, established facts; nor did he
repudiate the statement that the conditions described<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
by the author existed in duplicate form
or worse in many garrisons of the empire.</p>

<p>The Kaiser himself was forced, much against
his will, to take notice of Bilse&#8217;s book. A detailed
report was made to him by the chief
of his Private Military Cabinet, General von
H&uuml;lsen-H&auml;seler, on all the essential facts underlying
the plot of <i>A Little Garrison</i>. He
expressed himself as much grieved at the terrible
revelations in it. In their totality they
presented a state of facts of which he himself,
thoroughly acquainted as he had deemed himself
to be with conditions in his army, had been
ignorant.</p>

<p>The immediate outcome of this conviction on
his part was the issuance of a secret decree directed
to the various commanders of the twenty-three
army corps composing his army. In
this decree he called the attention of these commanders
to the awful conditions laid bare in
Bilse&#8217;s book, and bade them watch hereafter
with greater zeal over the morals and discipline
of their various corps. The decree he ordered
to be read by each commanding colonel to his
subordinate officers, threatening with expulsion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
from the army any officer who should hereafter
be guilty of such heinous behavior as exemplified
by the characters in Bilse&#8217;s book.</p>

<p>It might, therefore, be supposed that a thorough
reform of the whole moral status of the
German army was now under way, or that it
had been at least initiated by this action of the
Kaiser. Certainly, there is no one in all Germany
who takes a deeper interest than he in
the welfare of his army, or who has a profounder
conviction of its importance in maintaining
the empire&#8217;s proud position as a world
power. On many occasions the Kaiser has emphasized
his belief that this, &#8220;the most precious
legacy&#8221; left him by his grandfather, must be
kept intact to secure his own throne and the
nation&#8217;s predominance in the heart of Europe.</p>


<p class="thoughtbreak">But it would be short-sighted to assume this.
The causes that have been at work for thirty
years past, undermining and honeycombing the
whole structure of the German army, are too
manifold, too much ingrained in the very fibre
of the German people of to-day, and too complex
to yield at the mere bidding of even so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
imperious a voice as the Kaiser&#8217;s. Bilse, in his
book, lays a pitiless finger on the ulcers that
have been festering and growing in the bosom
of the army; but his story, after all, is that of
only one small garrison, and refers to but a
brief period in the very recent past.</p>

<p>It may be worth while, in order to give the
reader a more comprehensive and more general
view of conditions in the German army of to-day,
briefly to survey some patent facts.</p>

<p>The wide spread of the gambling spirit is one
of these. Against it the Kaiser has inveighed in
army orders since his accession to the throne,
but all in vain. This evil spirit is as strong to-day
as ever. It was but a few years ago that a
monster trial took place in Hanover. It showed
a frightful state of rottenness within even the
most renowned regiments&mdash;those of the Guard
Corps, in which the scions of nobility hold it
an honor to serve. The details of this trial were
a shock to the whole country, and it ended by
dismissal or expulsion from the army of a score
of officers bearing, some of them, the most ancient
and honored names within the empire.
Even one of the Kaiser&#8217;s own aides-de-camp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
issued from it with a reputation so besmirched
as to lead to his hasty retirement. More recently
still the Club of Innocents (<i>Club der Harmlosen</i>)
became the cynosure of all eyes, but
unenviably so. It was not, strictly speaking, a
military club, but it counted in its membership
list a majority of active army officers. I will
not go into details, but merely mention that one
of the chief victims of the diabolical machinations
practised by a number of high-titled black-legs&mdash;officers
of this club&mdash;was young Prince
Alfred, a grandson of the late Queen Victoria,
whose complete moral and physical ruin was
wrought, soon followed by his death. The
Jockey Club in Berlin, made up largely of officers,
and similar organizations in Potsdam,
Charlottenburg, Hanover, Cassel, Dresden,
Brunswick, Cologne, and, in fact, nearly every
other garrison town of any importance within
the empire, have all had their list of scandals
during recent years,&mdash;scandals brought about
by unprincipled gamesters belonging to their
corps of officers. Probably several thousands
of resignations, semi-enforced retirements, or
outright dismissals from the army have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
due during the last decade to this one evil of
high play alone.</p>

<p>The hard drinking indulged in throughout
the army, to a degree which to the ignorant outsider
seems incredible, is another evil of perhaps
as great magnitude. Of that Bilse&#8217;s book gives
a faithful impression. For these excessive
drinking habits, and in an equal degree for the
luxurious habits of life, more particularly the
indulgence in sybarite banquets, the Kaiser himself
must be held largely to blame, since, by
force of example at the many &#8220;love feasts&#8221;
(<i>Liebesm&auml;hler</i>) and anniversary celebrations of
every kind which he not only attends at the
quarters of the various regiments throughout
the German domain, but which he very frequently
arranges for or encourages himself, he
has taught his army officers a direful lesson.
Certainly, the old Spartan simplicity in food and
drink which prevailed in German army circles
during the days of William I., grandfather of
the present ruler, has gone forever.</p>

<p>A direct outgrowth of the luxuriousness prevalent
in the German army of to-day is two other
evils which in their consequences on the morals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
of the officers can scarcely be overrated. They
are epitomized by the two words &#8220;army usury&#8221;
and &#8220;money marriages.&#8221; To live beyond one&#8217;s
means leads to indebtedness. And there we
have the simple genesis of the army usurer, so-called.
He exists and thrives in every garrison
in the empire, and the broad swath he mows
within the ranks of the army testifies to his diligence
and to his successful methods. It would
be going too far to expatiate on this matter.
Suffice it to say that the system by which the
usurer brings hundreds, nay thousands, to disgrace
and premature retirement from the army,
usually involving the impoverishment of the
officers&#8217; families, is wellnigh perfection in itself.
Within his net are driven, at some time or other,
the vast majority of the younger men as well
as a great many of the older ones.</p>

<p>The favorite avenue of escape offered to the
young spendthrift officer is a so-called money
marriage. He barters himself, his social position,
and the prestige which the ownership of
an old and honored name still carries with it
in Germany, for the gold which his bride brings
him on the wedding day. Dowries must of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
course correspond in some measure with the
load of debt the young officer has been accumulating
for years, and also with his claims to distinction
and attractiveness. Such dowries vary
between a paltry twenty thousand and several
million marks, strictly according to circumstances.
There is an unwritten code in force in
this respect, every paragraph of which is made
and provided to cover the individual needs of
such impecunious officers. The matter is well
understood throughout the land, and is looked
upon as an established institution, something in
which squeamish scruples are not allowed to
interfere with concrete requirements. No German
maiden consciously feels the shame of
being thus made purely an object of barter and
sale. She is to the manner bred. But of course
good, fat dowries are often taken by officers,
together with brides, who in other respects by
no means realize their ideas of what a wife
should be. Enough said on this dreary subject!</p>

<p>Still another evil, and one which of late has
been much ventilated in Germany, is the abuse
of power by officers and non-commissioned
officers towards their subordinates. There has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
always been too much of this in the German
army, and it would carry us too far afield to
trace here the causes. In itself it seems a strange
anomaly that in an army which calls itself by
the proud term of a &#8220;nation in arms,&#8221; and
whose membership is recruited from every stratum
of society, there should be such wholesale
maltreatment of the privates by their superior
officers. And yet such is the fact, inexplicable
as it seems at first sight. Against this
curse the Kaiser has likewise launched his
thunderbolts at some time or other. But they
have had no effect. If anything there has been
an increase in such cases.</p>

<p>At a Reichstag session, in the middle of December,
the Kaiser&#8217;s spokesman, General von
Einem, made the formal admission that during
the preceding year no fewer than fifty officers
and five hundred and seventy-nine non-commissioned
officers had been court-martialed and
sentenced for cruelly maltreating their subordinates.
When we reflect that scarcely in one
case out of every hundred formal charges are
preferred by the victims, who know themselves
completely in the power of their tyrannous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
masters, the official record thus stated is indeed
appalling. But here again the Kaiser himself,
as chief commander of the army, must be held
largely responsible; for his more than lenient
treatment of the convicted offenders is nothing
less than a direct encouragement to their fellows
to continue in these fiendish practices.
One sergeant, a man by the name of Franzki,
belonging to the Eighty-fifth Regiment of the
Infantry, was shown at the trial to have been
guilty of no less than twelve hundred and fifty
individual cases of cruelty and of one hundred
cases of abuse of power. Another man, Lieutenant
Schilling, of the Ninety-eighth Regiment
of Infantry, stationed in Metz, had a
record against him of over a thousand such
cases. Both men were recently tried and convicted,
and the degree of their punishment
seems strangely inadequate. Yet in most instances
the Kaiser does not even allow these
convicted offenders to serve out their brief
terms of confinement, but issues free pardons
to them after they have undergone but a small
portion of their penalty.</p>

<p>However, from several points of view, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
most serious evil of all that has grown up within
the German army since the close of the Franco-German
War of 1870-1871 is the cleavage in
sentiment between the army and the nation.
That also has been demonstrable on many occasions
during recent years. I recall the case of
Lieutenant von Br&uuml;sewitz, of Carlsruhe. This
young officer ran his sword through the back of
a defenceless civilian by whom he fancied himself
insulted in a restaurant, the man dying
within a few hours of the deed. His murderer
attempted no other exculpation, or indeed explanation,
than by saying that according to the
army code of honor he was forced to avenge on
the spot the insult offered him. Br&uuml;sewitz was
sentenced to merely a mild type of confinement
for a term of two years, but was pardoned by
the Kaiser at the expiration of a twelvemonth.
A more recent case was that of a young navy
lieutenant who likewise stabbed to death with
his sword a former schoolfellow and townsman
who had not saluted him on the street with
sufficient ceremoniousness. That, he said, was
his only reason for killing the man, and he, too,
received a very mild sentence. Even worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
was the case of two officers quartered in a small
garrison of the province of East Prussia, close
to the Russian border. These men, being somewhat
in liquor on New Year&#8217;s Eve, mortally
wounded one civilian and gravely wounded another
for no other reason than that these men
had shouted a song distasteful to them, the
whole occurrence happening in the street after
midnight. The officers got off with a ludicrously
small punishment.</p>

<p>Such facts as these&mdash;and they could be multiplied
indefinitely&mdash;show, above all, one thing:
the striking difference in the conception of what
is termed &#8220;honor&#8221; obtaining between the officers
in the army and the bulk of the population,
the citizen element. The so-called &#8220;army code&#8221;
embodies views which it is euphemism to call
medi&aelig;val&mdash;remnants of the dark ages. And
yet these views are not excused; no, they are
upheld and endorsed by the Kaiser, his government,
and by the army in a body.</p>

<p>The &#8220;code&#8221; also brings about that other
absurdity, the army duel, as a mode of settling
all serious &#8220;affairs of honor.&#8221; About that
enough has been written in Germany itself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
fill whole libraries, and yet the foolish thing
continues. The Kaiser, grown up in all the
prejudices of caste as held by his ancestors and
by the present generation of the upper classes
in Germany, has done nothing to eradicate this
evil. The provisions made by him, and now
carried out, for regulating the practice of duelling
in his army, have had only the effect of
rendering the duel as an institution still more
respectable.</p>

<p>The main reason which impelled me to secure
the authority for presenting his little work in
an English dress was the fact that it tells a truthful
tale about an organization of such first-rate
importance as the German army. It paints that
organization not only as he himself saw it, but
as in its essential features it really is. In doing
this Lieutenant Bilse has not only rendered an
enormous service to his own country,&mdash;as indeed
many thousands of Germans are recognizing
to-day,&mdash;but he has also enabled the rest of
the world to gain a clear insight into the inner
mechanism of the most powerful fighting-machine
in the world, has shown its hidden flaws,
its grave organic defects, and has thus permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
us truly to gauge its inherent power. But interwoven
with his criticism there is the hope, nay
the conviction, that the main part of the machine
is still sound.</p>

<p>A book of this kind, &#8220;written from the inside,&#8221;
has a strong merit of its own not to be
measured by its purely literary qualities; for
these, I am free to admit, are not of the highest
order. There is talent in it, when considering
that it is the first effort of a literary tyro; but
its great value lies in its intense realism, interpreting
that word in its higher sense.</p>

<p>I have been compelled to make some alterations
and omissions in my work of translation.
The omissions have been due to the
conviction both of myself and of my publisher,
that the author has in certain instances given
a mass of unnecessary details to which serious
objection might be urged, in this country at
least, on the score of clean literary taste. The
alterations were either dictated by similar considerations
or grew indirectly out of them.</p>

<p>With these exceptions mentioned, however,
my translation may fairly claim to be true to
the spirit of the original. Even the strictest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
moralist will not cavil at seeing equivocal situations
painted in Bilse&#8217;s book when his purpose
in doing so has been the radical exposure of ills
existing in a body around which cluster so many
traditions of honor and duty well done as is the
case with the German army. And there is no
excuse to be offered by me for furthering that
task.</p>

<h3>AN EVENING PARTY AT CAPTAIN K&Ouml;NIG&#8217;S</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>tanding</span> in the centre of her parlor, a
spacious and cosy one, Frau Clara K&ouml;nig
let her eyes glide over the arrangements made
for the reception of her guests.</p>

<p>For this was her regular <i>soir&eacute;e musicale</i>, when
she saw assembled about her, one evening each
week, those of her more intimate friends who
dallied habitually with Euterpe, loveliest of the
Muses. To-night, however, her invitations had
not been so restricted, for she had asked some
other families to come, largely for the laudable
purpose of admiring the musical achievements
of the &#8220;artists.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she placed a chair in its proper place;
there she smoothed with tapering fingers one
or the other of the tidies, products of her own
skilful needle, which, in every hue and size,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
adorned the furniture. She tested the various
lamps; opened and shut piano and parlor organ
to convince herself of the absence of dust; and
finally minutely inspected sundry vases, deftly
manipulating their lovely contents, so that each
flower and each enfolding leaf stood out to
greatest advantage. This was one of her specialties.
At none of her parties, even in mid-winter,
was there a lack of tastefully grouped
nosegays and bits of green on mantel and corner
brackets.</p>

<p>Frau Clara was a woman of about thirty, with
a well-proportioned figure and a rather pretty,
rosy face. Her lively blue eyes and a wealth of
well-groomed hair combined to give her a look
of pleasant youthfulness.</p>

<p>These last touches done, she seated herself
on a low stool, for her thoughts pronounced it
all good.</p>

<p>And now the heavy drapery was thrust aside,
and her husband appeared&mdash;a tall man with a
black moustache. He, too, came to attend to
his share of the preparations. He lit up the
chandelier. Usually he gauged the number of
gas jets lit by the number of guests expected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
one for each. But inasmuch as there were only
five jets and about a dozen guests to come, he
indulged in the luxury of igniting them all. He
did this with various groans at the latest outrageous
gas bill, and next inspected the stoves.
Then he also sank down into a seat.</p>

<p>Albrecht K&ouml;nig was captain in the cavalry
regiment quartered in the town. His squadron
was always in apple-pie order, for he devoted
to it his entire energy during waking hours.
Brief intervals of leisure he filled by glancing
at the <i>Deutsche Zeitung</i>, studying the money-market
reports, toiling in the large garden behind
the house, which he always kept in almost
as good order as his squadron, and superintending
his hennery, the useful output of which he
sold to his wife at more than current prices.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
And if there was nothing else to do, he had
scientific skirmishes with his nine-year-old,
attended wine-tests,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or practised on the piano,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>an instrument which he played almost as well
as might have been wished by his friends.</p>

<p>A noise in the hall told of the arrival of the
first guest. A heavy, dragging step and a snorting
breath told them who it was. The door
opened, and Agricultural Counsellor von Konradi
made his appearance. A rather fleshy sort
of man, with glasses on his aristocratic nose,
over the tops of which his eyes sought the lady
of the house. His hair was dyed a fine dark
shade, and envy proclaimed that this was done
on account of the fair sex; for he was unmarried.
His two ideals in life, however, were
a good dinner and several bottles of even a
better wine to go with it. Since he realized both
of these ideals in the captain&#8217;s house, he was
fond of going there. As to the rest, he was held
to be a gentleman.</p>

<p>While he was at the critical point in a story
embodying his profound grief at the arrival
from his estate of a pheasant in a scandalously
unripe condition, the door opened again and
admitted the spouse of Captain Kahle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>Of a dainty, petite figure, and with a face that
seemed to belong to a <i>gamin</i>, she presented on
the whole a graceful enough <i>ensemble</i>. But
there were two drawbacks&mdash;her rather large
mouth was wreathed in a stereotyped smile, and
when she opened it it gave utterance to a voice
of somewhat unpleasant, strident timbre.</p>

<p>Three youngish men followed on her heels.
The first of them was Lieutenant Pommer, who
was somewhat of a general favorite because of
his unaffected, frank demeanor. Occasionally
it became a trifle rough or rude; but you always
knew where you had him. With special ardor
he saluted Frau Kahle, and it looked almost
droll to watch the contrast between him, a burly,
corpulent fellow, and this tiny, fragile figure
that resembled a Dresden china shepherdess.</p>

<p>The second one was Lieutenant M&uuml;ller.
Those who did not know him could have
guessed from his stiff, self-contained mien that
he must be the regimental adjutant. Housewives
dreaded him, for his appetite was Gargantuan.
With stoic defiance of all warning
glances he was in the habit of demolishing thrice
the quantity of the daintiest eatables apportioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to each guest. After everybody else had put
down his fork, his invariable way was to help
himself once more liberally, saying it was his
favorite dish.</p>

<p>The last of the trio was Lieutenant Kolberg,
an amazingly pale young man with <i>moustaches
&agrave; la Kaiser</i>. He led a life against which moralists
might have urged arguments, and there
had been various scandals connected with his
past.</p>

<p>While the other guests were waited for, a few
groups were being formed. Lieutenant Kolberg
approached Frau Kahle and measured her from
top to toe with approval. The adjutant made
a clever attempt to find out from the hostess
what particular dishes were in store for him.
Having ascertained this, he at once swore they
were his special delectation. Herr von Konradi
was chatting with Captain K&ouml;nig about a wine-testing
trip into the Moselle district which they
were jointly planning in order to replenish their
respective cellars.</p>

<p>Another lady entered, one whose corpulency
and unskilfully powdered face and arms made
an unpleasing contrast with a badly fitting robe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of black and yellow. She ran up to Frau Clara
and squeezed her hand in her wobbly fingers,
expressing joy at the invitation. To the gentlemen
who sidled up to her one after the other
she extended that same chubby hand with a
fatuous smile, but holding it so high that they
could not do otherwise than touch it with their
lips.</p>

<p>This was Frau Captain Stark, the latest
spouse in the regiment, though probably past
the demi-century line.</p>

<p>Her lord, likewise of rotund shape, came after
her. He wore a black Vandyke beard, and his
special forte was a carefully trained and extremely
long nail on the little finger. It was
said that this nail demanded a goodly portion of
his leisure hours. His voice told its own story
of bonhommie and unctuous Rhine wine.</p>

<p>Behind this couple hove in sight the figure of
the commander. Everybody stepped aside with
a show of deference, and all around he was saluted
with deep bows, while he slowly stepped
up to Captain K&ouml;nig and his lady. The bowlegs
and the robust body were not relieved by a
face of finer mould, and thus it was that Colonel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
von Kronau scarcely corresponded with the
popular conception of a dashing cavalry officer.
Most striking about him was a tear that permanently
glistened in the corner of his eye. This
tear he always allowed to grow to a certain size,
when he would, by a dexterous motion born of
long practice, propel it from its resting-place
over at his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, either at the latter&#8217;s feet
or in his face, as the case might be. It largely
depended on the size of the tear and the rank
of his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>.</p>

<p>The lady who accompanied him and who had
the face and manners of a governess was his
better half. She had squeezed herself on this
occasion into a dowdy dress of pearl-gray silk,
with a purple collar of velvet.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously the remainder of the
invited personages filed in. There was First
Lieutenant Borgert. His shifting eyes seldom
looked squarely at any one whom he deigned
to address. He was fleshy, but his movements
were nevertheless elastic and suave. Behind
him stood First Lieutenant Leimann, under-sized
and prematurely bent, with a neck several
sizes too short for him and a suspicion of deformity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
between the shoulders. A pear-shaped
head protruded from between them, fitfully lit
up by a pair of pig&#8217;s eyes, which either restlessly
shot glances or else were so completely buried
under their lids as to become invisible. A
monocle hung down his bosom from a broad
ribbon, but he never used it, for fear of becoming
ridiculous.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen dwelt together in the
same house, each occupying a floor, and were
inseparables. Though perennially short of cash,
they saw no reason to deny themselves the luxuries
of this mundane sphere. On the contrary,
they lived like heirs to great fortunes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, my gracious lady,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> remarked
Leimann to the hostess, &#8220;but my wife could not
come immediately, having her old complaint&mdash;nervous
headache, you know!&#8221; In saying this
he made a face as though he didn&#8217;t himself
believe what he was saying. &#8220;But she will
doubtless come a bit later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to hear it,&#8221; Frau Clara sweetly answered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8220;but I hope she will soon feel well
enough to appear.&#8221;</p>

<p>After little Lieutenant Bleibtreu, a special
friend of the house and the only subaltern in
Captain K&ouml;nig&#8217;s squadron, had in his turn saluted
everybody, the servant announced that
the meal was served. The diners, in couples,
ranged strictly according to rank, passed in.
The dining-room looked cheerful, and the table
had been arranged with Frau Clara&#8217;s customary
taste.</p>

<p>Everybody having been served, conversation
started slowly. &#8220;The weather has turned so
fine of late that we can commence playing
tennis,&#8221; remarked Frau Colonel von Kronau.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; chimed in her husband, masticating
vigorously. &#8220;I shall call a meeting of
the club next week, and then nothing will stand
in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charming!&#8221; enthusiastically fluted Frau
Stark. &#8220;I love it passionately, and you, of
course, will all join in? You, my dear Frau
Kahle, were one of the most zealous members
last season. And how is it with you, Frau
K&ouml;nig?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to forego the pleasure,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;for it does not agree with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to play,&#8221; the captain said;
&#8220;but I like to watch graceful ladies at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Stark bit her lips and shot an angry
glance at the captain. &#8220;What did he mean by
&#8216;graceful ladies,&#8217; anyway?&#8221; she thought. That
was meant for her, no doubt. And she remembered
unpleasant comment made because she
with her fifty years had started riding a patient
old mare belonging to her husband&#8217;s squadron.
One of the sergeants was giving her lessons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some civilians, I believe, will join,&#8221; broke
in the colonel. &#8220;I will have a list circulating.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody knew this was buncombe, the
colonel being extremely unpopular in civilian
circles, and they smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will join you,&#8221; said Herr von Konradi,
&#8220;provided the heat is not excessive. Next
week, however, I have no leisure. I must sow
my peas, or it will be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in K&ouml;nig, &#8220;or they will not
thrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Not thrive? Peas will always turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
out well if properly attended to,&#8221; said the
colonel&#8217;s wife, with a touch of asperity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I must contradict you, my gracious
lady,&#8221; retorted the captain. &#8220;Last year&#8217;s did
not turn out well anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be sowed at moonlight, and not
a word be spoken, then they will do finely, every
time,&#8221; said the Frau Colonel, eagerly. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t imagine that I am superstitious. I am
simply stating a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a bold thing to do, for whatever the
colonel&#8217;s wife said must not be gainsaid, yet
Lieutenant Bleibtreu could not help it. He
laughingly said: &#8220;Sowing, therefore, bacon in
between while the sun is shining, we&#8217;ll have one
of my favorite dishes ready made.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel&#8217;s lady merely transfixed him with
an envenomed stare. After a dramatic interval
she resumed: &#8220;But, come to think of it, I myself
won&#8217;t have leisure next week. My goose-liver
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute;s</i> are not yet finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You prepare them yourself?&#8221; asked the
agricultural counsellor with deep interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. I do up six potfuls every year.
The colonel dotes on this kind of stuff.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where do you procure your truffles,
may I ask? I am myself looking for a trustworthy
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Truffles? Nonsense, it tastes every bit as
good without them&mdash;that is all imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must excuse me, my gracious
lady; truffles are the very soul of a goose-liver
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>. Without them it is insipid&mdash;&#8216;Hamlet&#8217;
with Hamlet left out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hamlet&#8217;?&#8221; rejoined the lady with the
governess face. &#8220;We were talking of truffles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr von Konradi shrugged his shoulders.
Nobody else said a word. Just then Frau First
Lieutenant Leimann entered. She looked as
fresh and bright as the morning star.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand pardons, Frau K&ouml;nig,&#8221; she
smiled, &#8220;but I had to finish some important
letters.&#8221; And she sat down in the place reserved
for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard you were suffering from headache,&#8221;
was the general remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Headache? Yes, I forgot&mdash;I did have it.
But that is such an old story with me that I
scarcely think of mentioning it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a handsome young woman, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fact was made more apparent by the really tasteful
gown she wore.</p>

<p>During all this time the adjutant had not said
a word. He attended strictly to the business
that had brought him here. His voracity attracted
no attention, because everybody was
used to it. Off and on he merely emitted a
species of grunt in token of approval or dissent
of what had been said. He was still eating when
the hostess finally gave the signal to rise. Then
everybody wished everybody else a &#8220;blessed
digestion,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and made for the adjoining rooms,
where the ladies were served with coffee and the
men with cordials, beer, and cigars.</p>

<p>Informal chatting was indulged in. The
colonel, after briefly despatching a trifling matter
connected with the service, for which purpose
he retained M&uuml;ller, who was fairly oozing with
good cheer, retired to a quiet corner with Frau
Stark. Since their conversation was carried on
in whispers, First Lieutenant Borgert, despite
strenuous efforts to overhear, could only catch
a phrase or a single word from time to time.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>must</i> manage it,&#8221; he heard her say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope that the annual inspection will
turn out well,&#8221; replied the colonel. &#8220;Last time
our direct superiors were finding fault with your
husband. It began in the stables, and I heard
some talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind all that, Colonel, my husband
<i>must</i> be promoted to be major. I tell you
plainly, if you drop him I shall&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fears, my most gracious lady. I
have given him a very brilliant report, though
he doesn&#8217;t deserve it, as you know. But I shall do
my best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you owe me your best, Colonel, as you
very well know, for without me you would be
to-day&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain K&ouml;nig came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the Herr Colonel not accompany us
next week on a wine-testing trip up the Moselle?
Agricultural Counsellor von Konradi will make
one of the party. Some exquisite growths are
to be sold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, my dear K&ouml;nig. You know that
I always join in such expeditions. And with
you in particular I like to go, for your dinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
has shown me once more that you own a faultless
&#8216;wine tongue.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very flattering, Colonel. But I see you are
still cigarless; everything is laid out in my
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel stepped into the next room. Frau
Kahle was flirting with Lieutenant Pommer in
one corner, while several young men were doing
that with the pretty hostess in the other corner.
Just then First Lieutenant Leimann entered
from the dining-room, and behind him his
spouse, making a wry face. Her mien became
sunny, however, when First Lieutenant Borgert
stepped up to her and inquired with solicitude
as to the cause of grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! The usual thing,&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;My
husband has scolded me. You know his ungentlemanly
ways. Always rude and offensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the trouble this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely the fact that I had excused my lateness
at table by pleading unfinished letters, while
he had urged a headache. I am tired of his
eternal fault-finding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is valid reason for a divorce, my bewitching
lady,&#8221; smiled Borgert. &#8220;Look for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
another husband if you are tired of the present
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>She peered into his face inquiringly. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t imagine how serious I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if that&#8217;s the case, my dear lady, there
is no time like the present for planning a change.
How, for instance, would I do for a substitute?
Now, honor bright?&#8221; and he playfully fondled
her plump little hand.</p>

<p>She took this just as smilingly. &#8220;Before I
answer,&#8221; she said, coquettishly lowering her
eyelids, &#8220;I must know what you have to offer
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us sit down then and discuss this most
alluring topic in its various bearings,&#8221; laughingly
remarked he; and he led her to a divan,
where they sat down side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, pay close attention, please,&#8221; continued
he. &#8220;I offer you an elegant home, a neat
turnout, a tolerably groomed nag, a villa on
Lake Zurich, and a host of serving genii.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is to pay for it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay?&#8221; His wonderment was great. &#8220;Pay
for it? Why, what is the use of doing that? It
has become unfashionable, and besides, so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
good money is frittered away by paying. <i>I</i>
never pay, and yet I manage to live pretty
comfortably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All very well, but there is my husband to
think of besides,&#8221; joked the pretty woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you still have him; but meanwhile
you might try and accustom yourself to
me&mdash;as his successor, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Leimann nodded cheerfully and then
buried her empty little head in her hand, dreamily
scanning the carpet. The others had left
the two in sole possession of the room. The
eyes of the officer sought hers, and there
was a peculiar expression in them when they
met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you look at me that way?&#8221; said
she. &#8220;You make me almost fear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid of your most dutiful slave?&#8221; whispered
he, and his breath fanned her cheek.
&#8220;Ah, no. But do not forget our conversation,
loveliest of women. Things spoken in jest often
come true in the end.&#8221; She looked up and
smiled as if enchanted at the idea. Then she
rose, and when he grasped one of her hands she
made no effort to wrest it away. He imprinted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a long-drawn kiss on it. She shivered and then
rapidly glided into the adjoining room, where
the jumble of sounds produced by tuning a
variety of musical instruments was now heard.
The strident notes of violins, the rumbling boom
of a cello, and the broken chords of a piano were
confusedly mingling, and the male guests were
slowly dropping in or taking up a position, a
half-smoked Havana or cigarette between the
lips, just outside the door, so as to combine two
sources of enjoyment. Borgert had remained
behind in the next room, and was now studying
intently a letter the contents of which plunged
him in a painful reverie. At last he put back
the letter in his breast pocket, audibly cursing
its sender, and then joined the group nearest
him.</p>

<p>At the parlor organ Captain K&ouml;nig was
seated, while his wife had taken charge of the
piano accompaniment. Herr von Konradi and
First Lieutenant Leimann stood ready with
their violins, while Lieutenant Bleibtreu, the
violoncello pressed between the knees, occupied
the rear. The auditors, at least the majority of
them, were comfortably ensconced in chairs or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sofas, near the mantelpiece, and around a table
on which a small battery of beer mugs, steins,
and tankards was solidly planted.</p>

<p>They began to play: a trio by Reinhardt. It
sounded well, for the performers had practised
their respective parts thoroughly. But there
were some disturbing factors, as is always the
case with amateurs. The unwieldy agricultural
counsellor rose on his creaking boots with every
note he drew, and frequently snorted in his zeal.
Leimann, too, was one of those one must not
look at while performing, for his queer-shaped
head had sunk between his shoulders and his
bowed back presented a rather un&aelig;sthetic picture.
The cellist, whose fingers were rather
thick, occasionally grasped the wrong string,
but tried to make up for this by bringing out the
next tones with doubled vigor. The trio was
followed by violin solos, and lastly by a Liszt
rhapsody, played by the K&ouml;nigs with warm feeling
and sufficient technique.</p>

<p>For <i>finale</i> the small audience overwhelmed
the players with praise, and some more or less
correct remarks were made about the different
compositions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Lieutenant Bleibtreu,&#8221; cried
Frau Stark, &#8220;I must resume my cello practice
with you. It is such a soulful instrument, and
I used to play it with tolerable proficiency in my
younger days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bleibtreu made a grimace, and Captain K&ouml;nig
whispered to him that the elderly lady was
unable to distinguish one note from another.</p>

<p>Borgert had looked on nonchalantly from the
door during the concert. Once in a while he
glanced sharply at Frau Leimann, who was
cosily reclining in an arm-chair, her eyes half
closed, a prey to thoughts.</p>

<p>The players had now taken seats at the large
table, and the conversation turned to trivial
affairs of the day, the Frau Colonel assuming
the lion&#8217;s share of it, for she was decidedly talkative.
Thus another hour passed; and when
the clock on the mantel marked half-past ten,
Colonel von Kronau gave his better half a look
of understanding, and the latter slightly nodded
in reply, and rose, saying to the lady of the
house, with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Frau K&ouml;nig, it was charming of you
to prepare such an enchanting evening for us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
But it is time for us to be going. Many
thanks!&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess made some polite objections; but
when she saw that the Starks too, and the agricultural
counsellor began to take formal leave,
she desisted from any further attempts to retain
her guests, not dissatisfied, on the whole, that
but a small circle remained. For with them it
was not necessary to weigh words as carefully
as in the presence of the colonel. It frequently
happened that he, the day after a social gathering,
took occasion to reprove his captains and
lieutenants for a careless turn of phrase or for
something which he construed as a lack of
respect shown to him or his wife.</p>

<p>Those five gone, the others moved their chairs
closer together around the table, and some fresh,
foaming nectar was served. Borgert started the
talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice how this Stark woman again
had a whispered confab with the colonel?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Such manners I think they ought to
leave at home, for there they are not very particular.
Just fancy, the other day I was witness
when Stark threw a slipper at his wife, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
on her part had received me in a horribly soiled
and frowzy morning gown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw worse than that,&#8221; interrupted Leimann.
&#8220;Last week they had in my presence
one of their frequent matrimonial disagreements,
and the fat one, her husband, clinched
the matter by shouting at her: &#8216;Hold your
tongue, woman!&#8217; A nice, lovable couple, those
two!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, it seems as if she lorded it over
him pretty effectually,&#8221; broke in the adjutant.
&#8220;Day before yesterday Stark had had his fill at
the White Swan, and when he became a trifle
noisy and quarrelsome his wife arrived on the
scene and behaved simply disgracefully. Finally
she tucked him under her arm and took
him home amidst the shouts and laughter of the
other guests. I don&#8217;t think their meeting at
home can have been an angelic one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sort of thing happens every little
while,&#8221; remarked Pommer; &#8220;at least at the
Casino<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> she appears whenever he does not depart
punctually at mealtime, and calls him hard
names before the very orderlies.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she is keeping a sharp eye on him just
now,&#8221; said Captain K&ouml;nig, good-humoredly,
&#8220;for he wants to get his promotion as major,
or, rather, it is her ambition to become Frau
Major.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there can be no idea of that,&#8221; interjected
Borgert, with a great show of righteous
indignation. &#8220;If this totally incapable idiot
becomes major I ought to be made at least a
general. Though it is queer that the colonel
is evidently moving heaven and earth in his
behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good reason why,&#8221; retorted Leimann,
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know the story? And yet it is
in everybody&#8217;s mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then tell us, please, because we know not
a word of it, and I scent something fiendishly
interesting!&#8221; And Borgert rubbed his hands
in anticipation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, last year the colonel had, with his
usual want of tact, insulted a civilian&mdash;a gentleman,
you know. The latter sent him a challenge.
Our good colonel began to feel queer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
for while he is constantly doing heroic things
with his mouth, he is by no means fond of
risking his skin. So after some talk with her,
this Stark woman went to see the gentleman
in question as peacemaker. She told him that
the colonel was really innocent in the whole
matter, and that she herself had been the cause
of the trouble, having spread a false report
under an erroneous impression. She managed
to tell her yarn with so much plausibility as
entirely to deceive and bamboozle the other
party, who thereupon withdrew his challenge
with expressions of his profound regret. So,
you see, she saved the colonel&#8217;s life, for the
civilian is known as a dead shot. Since then
she has the colonel completely in her power, and
no matter what she tells him to do, he executes
her orders like a docile poodle dog,&mdash;a fact
which we all see illustrated every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that explains the whole mystery, of
course,&#8221; delightedly shouted Borgert. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you know any more such stories? For it is
really high time to call a halt. He has manners
like a ploughboy&#8217;s, and she like a washerwoman&#8217;s.
I&#8217;ll collect a few more tales of the sort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
It is simply shameful that one must submit to
the dictation of this woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are rumors that she had peculiar
relations with a well-known nobleman in her
younger days; but I know nothing positive,
mind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where in the world did you hear that
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My military servant told me. He happens
to hail from the neighborhood she comes from.&#8221;</p>


<p class="thoughtbreak">During this delectable interchange of gossip
the wife of First Lieutenant Leimann had listened
with gleaming eyes and heightened color;
it seemed wonderfully interesting to her. Captain
K&ouml;nig, on the other hand, sucked his cigar
thoughtfully, and his wife toyed with the
embroidered border of the table-cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so lost in thought, my gracious lady?&#8221;
Borgert said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was merely wondering what stories you
gentlemen might hatch against <i>us</i>,&#8221; she said
with some dignity.</p>

<p>He was about pathetically to disclaim any
such fell designs, when it was noticed that Frau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Kahle had risen to bid farewell, and with her
Lieutenant Pommer, whose escort home she had
accepted, her husband being off on a short
official trip.</p>

<p>They were barely gone, when Borgert remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we ought to subscribe for this poor
Kahle woman, just enough to enable her to buy
a new dress. I don&#8217;t think she has anything to
wear besides this faded, worn-out rag of hers.
I am sick of seeing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you ought to see her at home,&#8221; interjected
M&uuml;ller, in a minor key of disdain.
&#8220;There she looks worse than a slovenly servant
girl. And she doesn&#8217;t seem to find time to patch
up her dirty gown, while her boy, the only child
she has, runs about the streets like a cobbler&#8217;s
apprentice from the lower town. One thing,
though, that urchin <i>does</i> know&mdash;he can lie like
Satan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inherited from his mother, of course,&#8221; remarked
Borgert, when a cold and reproachful
look out of Frau Clara&#8217;s eyes made him stop in
the middle of his sentence. There was an embarrassed
silence for a minute, and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
talk was resumed it no longer furnished such
&#8220;interesting&#8221; material. Captain K&ouml;nig&#8217;s yawning
became more pronounced, and Leimann was
leaning back in his chair, dozing, with mouth
half open. His wife, too, showed unmistakable
signs of ennui, now that the scandal she loved
no longer poured forth. Her features, a moment
ago smooth and animated, now looked
worn and aged, losing all their charm. M&uuml;ller
was still digesting audibly, and hence it seemed
the proper moment for adjourning.</p>

<p>Amid unanimous assurances that &#8220;this has
been the most enjoyable evening this season,&#8221;
the leave-taking was finally effected, and the
captain accompanied his last guests down the
stairs, and returned after shooting the strong
bolt at the house door.</p>

<p>As he turned off the gas in the drawing-room,
he said to Frau Clara: &#8220;Quite interesting, this
evening! These are two gentlemen we shall
have to be on our guard against.&#8221;</p>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CASINO DANCE</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">&#8220;C</span>orporal Meyer</span>! Have all this
cleared out of the stable! Instantly!
What beastly filth is this? What? The stable
guard is not present? Then do it yourself; it
won&#8217;t hurt you. Forward, march! And then
bring me the parole book!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At your orders, gracious lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Captain Stark strode with rattling steps
up and down in the stable, followed by two
ragged-looking dogs. She wore a badly fitting
riding habit of slate-colored cloth, with a black
derby that had seen better days. In her right
hand she carried a whip with which now and
then she cut the rank atmosphere in a reckless
manner, so that the dogs slunk aside in affright.
Her keen eye pierced everywhere. She scanned
the black register boards nailed above the different
partitions, and studied attentively the tablet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
on which was marked in chalk the <i>ordre du jour</i>.
She came to a full stop behind two horses, the
only ones left behind by the squadron which had
gone off for drill to the parade grounds. Wrathfully
she glanced at the poor old beasts, the
bones sticking out of their wrinkled, badly
groomed skin like those of a skeleton. Then
she lifted the hind feet of the brown gelding
and examined the hoofs. She drew a small note-book
from her habit, and entered on the dated
page: &#8220;Remus No. 37. Left hind iron.&#8221; Next
she climbed the steep wooden stairs leading up
to the hayloft. There they were, the culprits,
two men of the stable guard, slumbering
peacefully, and not even awakened by the entrance
of the &#8220;squadron&#8217;s mother.&#8221; Quick as
a flash her whip rained a shower of blows, while
she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with you; attend to your work, you
lazy scum! I shall have you reported to the
colonel!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they flew down the stairs, and were at
the feed-cutter as if the devil himself were after
them. She met Corporal Meyer at the door,
breathless from running, but handing her the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
parole book. He clapped his heels together before
her so that the spurs jingled.</p>

<p>She pushed the greasy book aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does the idiot think?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Hold it before my eyes while I read it. Here
is an entry that the saddles and bridles are to
be inspected to-morrow. Have your men everything
in good shape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go and inquire of the sergeant-major.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Away! Bring him here, but this very
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant-major made a black face when
Meyer had delivered his message, for the
hours when the squadron was drilling or practising
were his choicest during the day. He
spent them, as a rule, in domestic bliss, having
his cup of coffee before him and the wife of his
bosom in close proximity. He was peacefully
enjoying his morning cigar when Meyer reported
to him the desire of the &#8220;gracious one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cursed his luck, but lost no time in girding
his loins with his sabre; shoved his cap on his
bald brow, and went rattling down the stairs.</p>

<p>The gracious one received him very ungraciously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Sergeant-major, is everything in readiness
for to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, but will once more examine
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night? You are crazy. At once. Loafing
must stop. And, mark you, I demand a
more respectful tone from you, or I shall report
your case to the colonel. Now bring me my
horse!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Horse, my gracious lady? That is out with
the rest of them. All horses were ordered out,
except these two lame ones,&#8221; and he pointed at
the two sorry steeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? My horse ordered out? What new
insolence is this? Let it be brought to me instantly.
One of the corporals can go on foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this moment she heard steps approaching,
and seeing Borgert she called out to him in
dulcet tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, what a pleasure, my dear First Lieutenant!
So early out on duty? I was just
about to give some sugar to my husband&#8217;s
horses, but find them already gone. My dear
husband is so excessively punctual in all that
concerns the service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your interest for the squadron is most
praiseworthy, my gracious lady,&#8221; said Borgert
with a malicious twinkle in his eye. &#8220;I have
often remarked you with secret admiration when
issuing orders to the men about the stable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Orders? Scarcely that, my dear Borgert.
Once in a while I am the messenger of my dear
husband when he has forgotten something. Of
course, I take an interest in all that concerns him
and the squadron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frau Captain is quite right, and I can only
congratulate you on the successful way in which
your interest in the squadron and in the whole
regiment takes concrete form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always jesting. But I suppose I
shall see you at the Casino to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly, we are to meet at five to talk over
some service matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you remind me. But that will not last
long. It concerns only some trifling affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged for the exact information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, I take an interest in everything,
as I said. I called the colonel&#8217;s attention
to divers things, and I presume he will talk them
over with you gentlemen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am curious to learn what they can be.
But, pardon me, I see Captain K&ouml;nig coming,
with whom I have to transact some business.
Good morning, my most gracious lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, <i>mon cher</i>!&#8221; And she held
her hand up high to him,&mdash;a big hand, which
was encased in a soiled, worn-out gauntlet of
her husband&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Then she turned once more to the sergeant-major,
while Borgert hastened to intercept
K&ouml;nig, who was on the point of turning into
the big courtyard of the third squadron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Herr Captain! I must beg
you to excuse me if I interfere with your liberty
for a moment, but a very pressing matter induces
me to ask of you a great favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You astonish me. What is the matter?
Is it anything of importance?&#8221; retorted the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon the colonel will doubtless
mention the unpaid Casino bills, and it would
be extremely painful to me, especially in the
presence of the junior officers, to have my name
spoken of in that connection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said Captain K&ouml;nig,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
&#8220;you&#8217;ll have to go elsewhere for the money.
It was difficult enough for me to raise that
hundred for you a week ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I repeat my request, nevertheless,
Captain, it is because I find myself in a horribly
embarrassing situation. For if I don&#8217;t succeed
in procuring four hundred marks till this evening,
I shall have to face the most annoying,
possibly disastrous consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All very well, but I simply haven&#8217;t the
money,&#8221; said the captain, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>For a moment or two there was silence, and
each avoided looking at the other. Then Borgert
murmured, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I make a proposition, Herr Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must ask you not to misunderstand
me. Would it not be possible to borrow so small
a sum from the funds of the squadron, since it
would be only a question of a few days?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain K&ouml;nig looked startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear fellow, how can you suggest
such a thing to me! You can&#8217;t expect me to
touch the treasury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think it would matter the least bit,
since the Herr Captain alone is responsible for
that fund, and since this would practically mean
nothing but the transferring of four hundred
marks from the public fund in your own keeping
to private funds of your own, to be made
good by you, without anybody being the wiser
within a week or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, that would never do,&#8221; again said
the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Captain, you cannot leave me in the
lurch. It would simply place me in a beastly
predicament,&#8221; wailed Borgert, glancing appealingly
at his brother officer.</p>

<p>K&ouml;nig began to think, twirling his moustache.
On the whole, he reflected, it might be a wise
thing to place under an obligation this man with
the dangerously bitter tongue. Borgert&#8217;s influence
on the younger officers was not to be underestimated,
he knew, and a refusal would turn
him into an enemy. The money itself he had,
locked up in a drawer of his desk at home; but
if he made Borgert believe that he had to &#8220;borrow&#8221;
it from the squadron funds,&mdash;whose
custodian he was,&mdash;it might be expected that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the lieutenant would not so soon ask for another
loan, mindful of the great difficulties this present
one was causing. It was as the result of these
cogitations that K&ouml;nig resolved to lend Borgert
the sum he required, but to leave him in the
belief that to do so it was necessary to touch
the funds in his care.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you shall have
your money. When will you pay it back without
fail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Within ten days, Captain. I give you my
word on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, come to my office at noon, and
you shall have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Accept my most grateful thanks, Herr
Captain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it; but I trust it won&#8217;t occur
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>They shook hands, and the captain mounted
and trotted off in a lively tempo toward the
parade grounds.</p>

<p>Borgert, elated and free of care, hastened
home. His duties to-day did not begin until
ten. He really felt kindly towards K&ouml;nig for
the moment. It was not the first time the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
had helped him out of a dilemma. Ten
days! Well, within ten days all sorts of things
could happen. Why not his ability to repay the
loan? And if not, bah! What is the use of
speculating about the future? For the moment
he was safe; that was the main thing.</p>

<p>Leimann meanwhile was awaiting the coming
of his friend in the latter&#8217;s study, and when
Borgert entered, serene of brow and humming
an operatic tune, his face too brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he done it?&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Go to him at eleven, and he will
do the same in your case, all the more as you
need it less.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at noon, when the two friends met at the
Casino over a bottle of fragrant Moselle, you
could tell from Leimann&#8217;s exuberant gayety that
his own request had not been refused.</p>


<p class="thoughtbreak">Punctually at five all the officers of the regiment
were assembled, with caps and sabres, in
the reading-room of the Casino. And when the
different squadron commanders had stepped up
and reported &#8220;Everybody present,&#8221; the colonel
at once let them know his mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, in his most pompous
manner, &#8220;I have commanded your presence in
order to talk over a few matters. First: I must
request that for the future, at balls and similar
affairs, dancing spurs be worn, so as to avoid
such unpleasant accidents as we had night before
last. One gentleman, who shall be nameless,&#8221;&mdash;and
as he said it he fixed a basilisk eye on
Lieutenant von Meckelburg&mdash;&#8220;tore off with
his spurs the whole edge on the robe of Frau
Captain Stark. This must not occur again,
gentlemen, and from now on I shall officially
punish similar behavior. Furthermore, it is
customary among persons of education not to
be first in stretching out a hand to shake that of
a lady. And if the lady herself offers her hand,
good manners in our circles requires that the
gentleman salute it with his lips. It was made
evident to me by the complaints of one of the
ladies of this regiment that some of you gentlemen
stand greatly in need of further education
on such points of etiquette.&#8221; This particular
passage referred to the fact that Lieutenant
Bleibtreu had omitted the customary hand-kiss
the other day, when Frau Captain Stark had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thrust her hand under his nose, his reason being
that she had worn an old pair of dogskin gloves,
soiled and wet by the rain.</p>

<p>Casting a big tear, which had meanwhile
gathered in his left eye, several yards away,
where it glittered in the sunshine, the commander
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Next, gentlemen, I formally forbid you to
visit another town without first obtaining leave
of absence. Whoever will visit the neighboring
town must ask my formal permission first, no
matter if the distance is inconsiderable. You
all remember that two of the gentlemen of this
regiment were forced to retire under peculiarly
distressing circumstances, because of large debts
contracted in the adjoining town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the Herr Colonel permit me a question?&#8221;
interrupted Captain K&ouml;nig.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, Herr Captain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this order intended to apply to married
officers as far as invitations to social entertainments,
the theatre, concerts, <i>et cetera</i>, are
concerned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most assuredly; I must retain exact control
of the movements of every one of you gentlemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
as often as he leaves the garrison. Infringements
I shall punish severely, in exact
accordance with the military penal code. Such
infringements I shall regard not as mere
breaches of discipline, but as direct disobedience
to my explicit orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause, the colonel whisking his
big bandanna out of the breast pocket of his
uniform coat, and carefully wiping his left eye.
This done, he looked about and saw disgust
plainly printed on every face around him.</p>

<p>Indeed there was disgust. Because two offenders
in the past had got themselves into
trouble, the whole corps of officers in town was
to suffer vicariously, forced to remain shut up,
even during their leisure hours, in a place offering
absolutely no intellectual and worthy relaxation.
The elder officers more especially felt all
the insulting tyranny that lay in this new order;
but iron-clad military discipline forbade even
a murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, gentlemen,&#8221; resumed the colonel,
after scanning the clouded faces around him for
another minute, &#8220;let us proceed to the election
of president of the Casino management, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the term has just elapsed. You, Captain Kahle,
filled that position for a year past, and I rejoice
to say that the manner in which you have done
so has found my full approval. Indeed, gentlemen,
all of us are indebted to Captain Kahle, for
he has done his best, by devoting the larger
portion of his leisure hours to the task, in improving
the management of our Casino. He
has enlarged our funds, and has introduced a
number of well-considered and highly welcome
ameliorations. It is for this, I think, we cannot
do better than to beg Captain Kahle to remain
in an office which he has administered so much
to our joint benefit. If, however, there should
be among you, gentlemen, somebody to propose
another man, let him speak up, for in that case
we must ballot in the regular manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>A unanimous murmur of approval, such as
never before had greeted utterances by the
colonel, ran through the assembly, and Kahle
issued as the choice of everybody from the oral
election. His office of dictator of the Casino
was one which involved much gratuitous labor
and frequent abuse, but was of the greatest
importance to his fellows, since it concerned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
so closely the most sensitive portion of a soldier&#8217;s
anatomy&mdash;his stomach.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not necessary to inspect the books,&#8221;
continued the colonel; &#8220;for I feel quite sure
that everything is in the best of order. But one
more thing, gentlemen! I cannot permit Casino
bills to grow in this avalanche fashion, such as
has been the case for months past. It is true
that the two highest accounts have been settled
to-day; but I warn you that henceforth I shall
proceed without leniency, if all the outstanding
bills are not settled by the first of next month.
Consider well what I have said! Thank you,
gentlemen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, most of the poor lieutenants
felt and looked decidedly blue. For some of
them it meant another loan in Berlin or Cologne
at usurious interest, with no prospect of ever
discharging the principal, which meant nothing
less than ultimate ruin and disgrace. For
others, less reckless or with less credit because
of more modest family connections, it meant
the paying off in monthly instalments of their
debts, which always led to a black mark against
their names in the regimental list of conduct,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
minimizing their chances of promotion when the
list would reach the eyes of the commanding
general and, finally, those of the Kaiser and of
his military cabinet. At best it meant a tussle
with the pater. But golden youth does not long
indulge in such gloomy reflections. That is its
privilege. Thus, then, after exchanging melancholy
views, the younger swarm broke and fled
into the garden or into the cool veranda.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ladies of the regiment convened
in the reading-room, and with them were
two young civilian gentlemen who had not been
able to withstand their combined blandishments,
and who had declared themselves ready to join
the tennis club. The main business of the evening
was to be transacted; namely, the election
of a board for the tennis club and the fixing of
certain days for play in the courts near the
Casino building.</p>

<p>Frau K&ouml;nig alone had not come, and her husband
had had formally to excuse her. The truth
was, she avoided as much as she could to meet
the wives and sisters of her husband&#8217;s comrades,
for she was not fond of the malicious, evil
gossip that formed their chief pleasure in life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
This natural inclination on her part had become
stronger since her recent evening party, when
she had heard how even most of the officers
themselves did not scruple to retail disgusting
bits of scandal. Of course, she was made to
suffer for this exclusive taste&mdash;or distaste
rather&mdash;and she knew perfectly well that the
scandal-mongers were only awaiting the slightest
opportunity to besmirch her own name and
that of Captain K&ouml;nig; but even so, she preferred
her own way.</p>

<p>The negotiations in the reading-room lasted
some time, for each one of the ladies had a wish
or an idea of her own to defend. Moreover, it
required the encouraging words of the elected
club officers to induce a number of newly arrived
gentlemen to become candidates for admission.
Of course they knew, these sirens, that nearly
all of these candidates would never show up at
the tennis courts; but at any rate the initiation
and membership fees were thus substantially
increased, and the ladies, of course, paid no
dues.</p>

<p>At last, however, the folding-doors of the
dining-room were thrown open. A substantial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but not very elaborate supper was to be served
there. The acrimonious and strident voice of
the Frau Colonel floated above all this babel of
feminine noises. In the corners stood, in little
groups, a number of the younger and older
officers, discussing, in subdued accents, the
latest decrees of their superior officer. They
were still vibrating with suppressed indignation.</p>

<p>Captains K&ouml;nig and Hagemann made sport
of Frau Stark, but in such manner that she never
suspected it. Lieutenant Pommer never quitted
the immediate vicinity of Captain Kahle&#8217;s
spouse.</p>

<p>Supper over, nearly all the men present had
the lively desire to escape from this promiscuous
gathering, into which they had been inveigled
under pretence of an official matter. But such
was not the intention of Frau Stark, who cried
out to the colonel in her domineering way:</p>

<p>&#8220;How about this, Colonel; cannot we make a
good use of this favorable occasion and arrange
a hop? Nobody, I suppose, would have any
objection? I myself would think it charming,&mdash;simply
delicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel took just one minute to ruminate;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
then he declared himself equally delighted with
the lady&#8217;s idea. For her wish had indeed become
his law&mdash;<i>dura lex sed lex</i>.</p>

<p>The men were in a rage. What folly to
dance, with the thermometer so high! Much
more sensible to sit down quietly on the veranda
and drink cool, frothy beer! Lieutenant Specht
felt particularly enraged, for he was to meet
his flame at the train about ten. He exploded
his anger, saying to Borgert:</p>

<p>&#8220;The old woman is crazy, with her eternal
dancing; but let us keep her in perpetual motion
to-night, just to teach her a lesson, until she
herself gives in!&#8221;</p>

<p>While the ballroom was being cleared of
chairs and got ready for the hop, couples were
promenading in the garden. The golden sickle
of the moon shed dim rays over the landscape
and made the towers and steeples of the town,
standing out at some distance, appear like misty
silhouettes. In the deep green of the bushes a
nightingale pealed forth his liquid plaint into
the balmy night air, while from the ballroom
inside the tuning of violins mingled inharmoniously.
From the town gusts of warm wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
carried snatches of a martial song, ground out
on the barrel-organ of a carrousel. All these
noises rose in a confused mass into the still air,
mingling with the laughter of the women and
the calls of the servants and musicians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Borgert gave a <i>gratis</i> performance
to a number of his younger comrades. He had
gathered them around him in the tennis courts,
where he strikingly imitated Frau Stark in the
r&ocirc;le of a tennis player. He showed how she
attempted to meet the balls with a racquet, and
how she picked them up, until these young men
were fairly dying with hilarity. He was too
funny, they said, and played his improvised
part really to perfection. At last, however,
Borgert tired of this &#8220;manly&#8221; sport, and his
audience dropped off, one by one, joining the
dancers inside. Borgert, though, enjoying the
mild night air, lit a fresh cigar and strolled
about the garden, his habitual cat-like tread
barely audible on the soft ground. Puffing the
fragrant weed, he suddenly spied, in the uncertain
glimmer of the moon, the sheen of a white
summer robe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho! A little intrigue,&#8221; he thought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
himself. &#8220;Maybe something of interest. Let&#8217;s
reconnoitre!&#8221;</p>

<p>He glided like a shadow among the flowering
lilacs, heavy with perfume, and when a few paces
from the figure in white, crouched and hid himself
behind one of the bushes. He could not
distinguish the outlines of the two figures
clearly, but he heard whispering. First, in low
tones, he made out the voice of Frau Kahle,
cooing like a turtle, and next it was the
<i>basso profundo</i> of Lieutenant Pommer, vainly
endeavoring to compress its volume into a
murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amazing! Has this coarse elephant turned
into a Romeo, sighing like a furnace?&#8221; he said
to himself, and listened with all his might.</p>

<p>The syllables and now and then the broken
words that he was able to understand from his
point of vantage seemed to afford him the
greatest delight. When the couple at last rose
and disappeared down the path leading to the
side entrance of the Casino, he left his hiding-place
and slowly followed in their footsteps.
An unholy smile played around his thin lips.
&#8220;Two more in my power!&#8221; he whispered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time the dancers inside were devoting
themselves, without interruption, to Terpsichorean
pleasures,&mdash;mostly waltzes, they being
the special delight of Frau Stark. When Borgert
entered the ballroom the band struck up the
latest waltz,&mdash;&#8220;Over the Waves,&#8221;&mdash;and he
noticed Frau Stark, flaming like a peony, perspiration
streaming down her rubicund face,
being handed, true to his programme, by Lieutenant
Specht to his smiling comrade, von
Meckelburg. Frau Stark just took the time to
gulp a glass of lemonade, and then was off
again, breathing hard, but still in the ring.
The atmosphere in the room was stifling, but
all the ladies, at least, seemed to enjoy themselves.
Officers&#8217; wives are proverbially insatiable
dancers.</p>

<p>After two rounds of the room von Meckelburg
was seen steering his victim towards a
chair near the open window. Frau Stark sank
into it, literally exhausted. She looked indeed
dripping. The young lieutenants had had
their revenge. She had &#8220;given in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert meanwhile had taken his stand in a
corner, where he bent over Frau Leimann, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was seated and fanning herself with her handkerchief.
Although fatigued from heat and
dancing, she looked most seductive in her pale
blue tulle, whose filmy lace clouds around throat
and bosom heightened the effects of her charms.
Borgert, bending over her, sniffed with sensual
delight a faint perfume, while he carried on a
whispered conversation in monosyllables with
her&mdash;a conversation which seemed to have
meaning but for these two.</p>

<p>In the reading-room the orderlies were busy
filling tulip glasses with that fragrant mixture,
a May bowl, so grateful in its delicious iced
condition, and yet so deceptive. Around a
plain table in the small side room, away from
the throng and undisturbed, several of the captains,
the colonel, and two of the younger officers
were playing &#8220;skat&#8221; at a penny the point.
One of the lieutenants, to judge from his heated
face and the anxious look on it, must be losing
heavily. Had this &#8220;little game&#8221; been arranged
to encourage the men under him in the economies
Colonel von Kronau had but now so
strongly recommended to them?</p>

<p>Lieutenant Specht just then was taking French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
leave. It was necessary for him to run to the
station and meet the young lady&mdash;a lovesick,
pretty little milliner from Cologne&mdash;who for
the time being dwelt in his unstable heart.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bleibtreu sat in a brown study,
a few feet away from the players, deep in his
melancholy thoughts. The army, his military
career, intercourse with his brother officers and
their ladies&mdash;it was all a grave disappointment
to him. His illusions were gone, though it was
but a couple of years since he had donned the
bright, showy, glittering dragoon uniform, so
attractive to the neophyte. He was thinking of
home, of his dear, patient, loving mother, whose
constant preoccupation he was; of his lovely,
self-denying sisters, whose dowry was fast going
while he was himself enjoying himself in the
&#8220;king&#8217;s service.&#8221; Was he? Was he &#8220;enjoying&#8221;
himself? Was this&mdash;this hollow, stupid
round of the coarsest pleasures and the equally
coarse and stupid round of duties&mdash;really what
he had looked forward to?</p>

<p>The young man sighed. The absence of the
wife of his captain, Frau K&ouml;nig, rendered him
still more melancholy. Bah, it was disgusting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
And to think that this was the profession most
highly honored, most envied in the fatherland!
To think that it had always been drummed in
his ears, ever since early childhood, that to
&#8220;wear the king&#8217;s coat&#8221; would exalt him high
above his fellow mortals!</p>

<p>Comradeship! What a fine word when it
bears out its full meaning, thought Lieutenant
Bleibtreu. But what was it here? What had
he found the practical construction of the term?
To follow, day by day, step by step, in the same
treadmill of dull routine, only relieved by occasional
but all too brief glimpses of the freedom
that lay beyond &#8220;the service&#8221;&mdash;that was the
meaning of comradeship. There was none of
that unselfish intimacy, that ready sympathy
and help between the members of the caste into
which he had risen on the proud day he first
read his name among the Kaiser&#8217;s appointments
in the <i>Armee-Verordn&#365;ngsblatt</i>. Dead sea
fruit! Ashes that taste bitter on the tongue.</p>

<p>Certainly there were exceptions. He himself
had heard of some such cases of comradeship
as he had dreamed of when still a slim little
cadet in the military academy: cases where one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
comrade lifted the other, the younger and less
experienced, up to his higher level; cases where
one comrade sacrificed himself for the other.
But these must be very rare, he thought, for
he had never seen such a case himself. What
he had seen was the casting into one stiff, unchanging
form of so many individualities not
suited to each other. It was the hollow mockery
of the thing that palled so on him. And what
would be the end?</p>

<p>Though young in the service, he had seen
men meant for better things broken as a reed on
the wheel of military formalism; he had seen
them retiring when but in the prime of life,
broken in spirit, unfit for any new career, impaired
in health, perfectly useless&mdash;victims of
the conventional ideas that rule supreme in the
army. Others he had seen forced to resign,
overloaded with a burden of debt, ruined financially,
physically, morally bankrupt,&mdash;all due
to the tinsel and glitter, to the ceaseless temptations
thrown into the path of the German army
officer. A young civilian, even when the son
of wealthy parents, is not coaxed and wheedled
into a network of useless expenditure, as is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
youngest army officer, waylaid everywhere by
the detestable gang of &#8220;army usurers,&#8221; who
follow him to the bitter end, knowing that to
repudiate even the shadiest debt means disgrace
and dismissal from the army to every officer, no
matter if his follies have been committed at an
age when other young boys are still subject to
closest supervision.</p>

<p>Deep lines had formed on Bleibtreu&#8217;s smooth
forehead, and he was visibly startled when the
cheery, round voice of his squadron commander,
Captain K&ouml;nig, recalled him to his surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s what they call pleasure,&#8221; said
he, sitting down on the sofa beside his young
lieutenant, for whom he felt something like paternal
affection. &#8220;If such entertainments were
at least arranged beforehand, with the consent or
at the instance of the juniors themselves,&mdash;for I
will say nothing about us older men,&mdash;but no!
Frau Stark commands, and the whole regiment,
from the colonel down to the youngest cornet,
has simply to obey. Disgraceful, I say. Why,
we cannot even choose our own tipple on such
occasions. The colonel simply orders that a
May bowl be composed, and we have to brew it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
drink it, and&mdash;pay for it. This evening will
cost us a pretty penny again. A glass of apollinaris
would be far more palatable, and certainly
much cheaper and appropriate at this temperature
than this confounded sweetish stuff, which
gives one a headache fit to split the skull next
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true, Captain,&#8221; replied the young
man. &#8220;This form of quasi-official pressure,
even in one&#8217;s private expenditures, is one of the
worst curses of our profession. It has indirectly
caused the ruin of many a promising young
officer, I&#8217;ve been told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy, you are quite right,&#8221; answered
K&ouml;nig. &#8220;It is amazing how many officers
have been forced into retirement of recent
years, solely because of unpaid and unpayable
debts. Things in this respect cannot go on
much longer. For the ruin of thousands of
these young officers means also the ruin of their
families, and among them many of the oldest
and best in the Empire. An unhealthy craze for
luxurious living has seized upon the army, and
God alone knows how it will end some day.
It is a thing which will and must frighten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
every true patriot, and I wish our most gracious
sovereign would take up this matter more
earnestly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, H.&nbsp;M. does not attach enough importance
to this chapter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet the remedy would be such a simple
one,&#8221; remarked the captain. &#8220;If H.&nbsp;M. would
simply issue a decree to the effect that no debts
of army officers up to captain&#8217;s rank shall be
recoverable in court, that would be the end of
army usury, and with it would be removed the
worst cancer of which the whole army suffers.
Once the certainty that ultimately they are sure
of their money would be gone, these leeches
would no longer trouble the gay and shiftless
young officer whom they now pursue with the
persistence of bloodhounds. But what is the
use of saying this? H.&nbsp;M. himself is not
without blame in these things. As long as his
personal example all tells the other way, how
can we expect the army to become prudent and
economical?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;However, Captain, that is not the sole
trouble. I think as long as we as a class&mdash;or
caste&mdash;are taught that we are something better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
than the civilian population, so long as we are
guided by another code of ethics, erecting an
insurmountable barrier around us, there can be
no real reform. Such prejudices, or rather such
systematic teaching, must inevitably lead to
sharp separation between the professional soldier
class and the rest of the people. Good
heavens, this is the twentieth century, and no
longer the middle ages, we&#8217;re living in. Caste
and exclusive privileges must go, else&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh! Sh! Lower your voice, my dear boy&mdash;the
colonel is looking our way, and over there
stands M&uuml;ller, the adjutant, always ready for
tale-bearing. Let us get up and take a stroll in
the moonlight, or, better still, let us go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant accompanied his superior
officer as far as the door of his dwelling, and
on the way spoke in tones of real concern of the
fact that the cleavage between the private soldier
and his superiors was so great.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;many of these
poor devils are every bit as well educated as
we,&mdash;some of them even better,&mdash;and as long
as this is supposed to be a &#8216;nation in arms,&#8217; and
not, as in the eighteenth century, an army of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mercenaries, no such strict difference, socially,
ought to be made. Do you know, I often think
the Socialists are not so wrong in some things
they urge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, my dear Lieutenant,
don&#8217;t let any such remarks escape you anywhere
else,&#8221; said Captain K&ouml;nig, in a scared voice.
But they had reached the captain&#8217;s door, and so
they shook hands and parted.</p>

<p>Bleibtreu lived at the other end of the straggling
little town. In walking leisurely home, he
followed his train of thought. The systematic
brutality shown the common soldier&mdash;even the
noncom. (though not in so pronounced a manner)&mdash;by
his fellow-officers had from the start
been very much against his taste. &#8220;They don&#8217;t
see the defender of the fatherland in him,&#8221;
thought he, &#8220;but merely the green man, unused
to strict discipline and to the narrowly bound
round of dull duties, the clumsy, ungainly recruit,
or the smarter, but even more unsympathetic
private of some experience whose drill
is an unpleasant task for them, and who, they
know, hates and abominates them in his heart.&#8221;
And he remembered scenes of such brutality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the unwilling witness of which he had been.
Such cruelty and abuse of power, he felt, was
playing into the hands of the Socialist Party.
&#8220;These young men, fresh from the plough or
the workshop,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;cannot help losing
all their love for the army. So long as they
serve in it, of course, they will not risk those
punishments for expressing their real thoughts
which the military law metes out with such
draconic severity; they will prefer suffering in
silence the injustice, cruelty, and inhuman treatment
to which, at one time or another, nearly
every one of them is subjected during their
period of active service. But once dismissed to
the reserve, how many, many thousands of them
will naturally turn to the only political party
with us which dares to oppose with courage militarism
and all its fearful excrescences! And
all this,&#8221; he continued inwardly, &#8220;is the natural
result of a long period of deadening, enervating
peace. Oh! If there were but a war! All this
dross would then glide off us, and the true metal
underneath would once more shine forth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to bed with these ideas still humming
in his brain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Borgert had been enjoying himself meanwhile.
His kind always does. He had, for a
few moments, tried to listen to the arguments of
Captain K&ouml;nig and Lieutenant Bleibtreu, while
they were seated on the sofa; but, pshaw! how
absurd to philosophize about these things, he
thought. Far better to take life as it comes.
And so he had joined the party at the gaming-table,
where one of the winners was just then
standing treat for a battery of Veuve Clicquot,
and as he slowly sipped the delicious beverage,
the bubbles rising like rosy pearls from the
depths of his chalice, he smiled with self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>But at last he, too, left the house and directed
his steps toward the far end of the garden,
where a small gate led directly into the street
at the end of which he dwelt. There! Again
Frau Kahle and uncouth, elephantine Lieutenant
Pommer! The May bowl, he thought, has
been too strong for his addled brain. And he
stepped silently aside on the velvety sward,
under the clump of lilacs. The nightingale,
from the centre of a thicket a score of paces
away, still fluted and trilled a song of passion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
And something like it, he made sure, big Pommer
was also pouring into the tiny ear of that
conquering flirt, the volatile spouse of Captain
Kahle. Having ascertained this, First Lieutenant
Borgert rapidly strode toward the interesting
pair, clinking his spurs and drawling forth
an accented &#8220;G-o-o-d evening!&#8221; as he came up
to them before they had had a chance to rise.
Pommer looked indescribably much like an idiot
in returning the salute; but the little woman,
with the ready wit of her sex, assumed the air
of an immaculate dove.</p>

<p>The players were the last to leave the Casino,&mdash;all
of them with heavy heads and some of
them with much lighter purse. Among the
latter was Leimann.</p>



<h3 class="chapter"><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"></a>Chapter III<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></h3>

<h3>THE CONSEQUENCES OF A MAY BOWL</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ext</span> morning the garrison&mdash;that is, the
officers of it&mdash;was slower and later in
awakening than usual. That cursed May bowl!
It was precisely as Captain K&ouml;nig had said:
terrific headaches paid for indulgence in its
seductive potency. Pommer, poor Pommer,
although waked by his servant at the usual time,
was still so much under the influence of the
fumes that had mounted to his silly head the
night before, that the only answer he was able
to make to the shoutings of his Masovian<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> man
was an unintelligible grunt. Then he turned
over on the other side and settled down to a solid
sleep.</p>

<p>At eleven he was still peacefully snoring, when
his man stepped up to his bed once more, and
undertook such violent and persistent manipulations
with the extremities of his master that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>the latter finally opened his eyes far enough to
let a little daylight and some sense into his dazed
brain. The bulky lieutenant stretched himself,
yawned, and at last remembered his doings of
the night before. With both mighty fists he
hammered his thick skull in disgust and despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy smoke&mdash;that&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; May bowl!&#8221; he
groaned, and then sat down in the chair beside
his couch to feel of his head, which seemed a
gigantic bass drum, hollow and reverberating.
Like a flash his desperate flirtation with the
wife of his own squadron chief came back to his
muddled consciousness.</p>

<p>Vaclav, his man,&mdash;whom he, for short, called
Watz,&mdash;brought in his morning coffee, and
after dressing with a great running commentary
of grunts and groans, he sat down to drink a
mouthful of the reviving decoction. But his
brain was still in a whirl, and the scenes of a
few hours ago passed rapidly, but in nebulous
form, before his clouded inner vision.</p>

<p>Dimly he felt ashamed of himself. He knew
he had not behaved like a gentleman, and he
thought he remembered that somebody had witnessed
the spectacle he had made of himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Specht? Meckelburg? Or M&uuml;ller? No&mdash;he
thought not. But Borgert? Yes, he thought it
was Borgert. No, no. But who? He gave it
up with another groan, and took a mouthful of
the cold coffee.</p>

<p>Anyway, he had behaved in a beastly fashion.
That he did know. But stop! Had she not told
him how badly she was treated by her husband&mdash;how
neglected&mdash;had she not appealed to his
gallantry and friendship? He felt uncertain.
All he knew with certainty was that he had been
a brute.</p>

<p>He buried his head in his brawny hands.</p>

<p>How had it been possible for him so to forget
himself?</p>

<p>He knew:&mdash;champagne luncheon with that
fellow Borgert,&mdash;a fellow whose powers of
consumption had never been ascertained. Then,
at dinner, that heavy &#8220;Turk&#8217;s blood&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to which
M&uuml;ller had to treat because of a lost bet. And
then, worst of all, that thrice-condemned May
bowl! And hadn&#8217;t they noticed it, the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>fellows, and hadn&#8217;t they filled him up notwithstanding,
or rather because, they saw that he
couldn&#8217;t carry any more liquid conveniently?
His big fist slammed the table.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>The man with the sore conscience and the
sorer head bade the unknown enter.</p>

<p>It was First Lieutenant Borgert, helmet in
hand. He pretended astonishment at the evident
condition of his comrade, but eyed him
sharply, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me if I come inopportunely, but a
rather delicate matter induces me to see you this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Officially or privately?&#8221; grunted Pommer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both, if you wish it,&#8221; answered the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a private matter I beg you will postpone
it,&#8221; said Pommer. &#8220;Let us talk about it some
other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret to say that I <i>must</i> insist on discussing
the matter now,&#8221; retorted Borgert, stiffly.
&#8220;You are aware, of course, that as the elder
man in the service I have the right, even the
duty, to remonstrate with you if I see occasion
for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Pommer reflected a moment. In years he was
the other man&#8217;s senior, and he had also visited
a university for a triennium before joining the
army, while the other had simply completed the
easy curriculum of the military academy. But,
true, Borgert was a twelvemonth ahead of him
in actual service. So he silently submitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then; to what matter do you
refer, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert assumed the air of a grand inquisitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Accident made me, last night, witness to a
scene which I am sorry to say, Herr Comrade,
I cannot otherwise describe than shocking. It
was in the most secluded spot of the grounds
near the Casino. The lady in question&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need proceed no further, Herr Comrade.
I know perfectly well that I am to
blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask you for an explanation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was intoxicated. That is the sole explanation
I can offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A strange one. Why, if you cannot drink
without losing your senses,&mdash;why, then, do
you drink at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that I was intoxicated was due in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
large measure to the very gentleman I am now
addressing, who would not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not go into such details,&#8221; Borgert
interrupted him. &#8220;You do not seem to
understand the gravity of your offence, and it
seems necessary that I should enlighten you as
a younger comrade on that point.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pommer felt indignant at this hypocritical
lecture, but before he could reply to it Borgert
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your offence is the most serious against
comradeship which can be conceived. Really,
it would be my duty to call the attention of the
lady&#8217;s husband to it if I did not trust in your
sense of honor to rectify the matter before any
more mischief is done. If you will promise me
to go at once and ask the lady&#8217;s pardon, and to
do all in your power to avoid any further cause
for scandal, I will on my part forbear to mention
what I saw. You must know, of course, that to
tell Captain Kahle would mean a challenge, a
duel, your enforced resignation from the army,
and maybe your death,&mdash;for he is a good shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert was very dramatic as he said this.
The r&ocirc;le of an austere prophet, calling a sinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to repentance and amends, had all the spice of
novelty for him. Inwardly he smiled at himself,
but outwardly he drew up his tall, sinewy
frame to its full height, and cast a hypnotizing
stare at the man before him, now slowly recovering
his usual sober frame of mind. And as
the sense of his wrong-doing began to overpower
poor Pommer, he bowed his towzled head
in misery. Two big tears crept slowly down his
tanned cheeks.</p>

<p>Borgert went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, of course, your duty to go at once to
the outraged husband as well, and to confess
your guilt. As I know Captain Kahle, he is not
the man to withstand a direct appeal to his clemency
if couched in appropriately contrite terms.
If you will pledge me your word of honor to do
as requested and to obtain the pardon of husband
and wife, you may count on my silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pommer glanced up. Tumultuous feelings
were surging in his breast, and so rapid had been
the revulsion from his first sentiments when
Borgert had opened the conversation, that what
was now uppermost in his mind was gratitude
for this discreet and wise friend. He rose, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with a pathetic gesture stretched forth his great
paw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is my hand,&#8221; he said, with a hitch in
his voice. &#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert clasped it a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, many thanks, for your sympathy
and aid in this sorry business,&#8221; the junior
mumbled, and surreptitiously wiped a briny
drop out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>Borgert left, very much satisfied with himself.
He had now among the younger officers
of the regiment another one who would henceforth
swear by him. He noisily clanked down
the shaky wooden stairs of the humble house
wherein Pommer occupied narrow quarters.
And Frau Kahle, too, was now in his power, he
gleefully reflected. Besides all that, there was
something positively piquant about the little
adventure,&mdash;something which would frequently
hereafter furnish him with pleasant
innuendoes and hints, understood only by those
immediately concerned, and which would supply
him, Borgert, with an endless fund of amusement.
He intensely enjoyed this propitious
ending to his machinations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Humming a tune, and feeling in the best of
spirits, he went home, gave his servant sabre,
cloak, and helmet, and mounted the stairs leading
up to Frau Leimann&#8217;s apartments.</p>

<p>She was not alone. The adjutant was present.
M&uuml;ller, in fact, had shirked his duties to-day,
the colonel being off on a hunting trip in
the adjacent extensive forest, having been invited
thereto by the royal head forester commanding
that district. Frau Leimann greeted
Borgert warmly, and while the latter and the
adjutant stepped to the window, looking at the
wife of Captain K&ouml;nig and Lieutenant Bleibtreu,
who were riding past the house on horseback,
Borgert seized the opportunity and deftly appropriated
the pretty woman&#8217;s hands, which he
kissed passionately.</p>

<p>Then he told them of his interview with Pommer,&mdash;told
it in such droll terms and with such
an abundance of mimicry, that his two hearers
could not help laughing immoderately. The
picture of ungainly, rough Pommer being in
the sentimental stage and a prey to a lacerated
conscience was too exquisitely ludicrous.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pommer sat at his desk, laboriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
inditing a letter to his mother, to whom
he opened his whole heart, as in duty bound.
Several of the strongest passages in his letter
were panegyrics on his new-won friend, Borgert,
whom he limned in colors so brilliant that the
original would indeed have had great trouble in
recognizing himself in the portrait.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had by this time calmed down
a good deal, and the blurred images of the past
evening resolved themselves, one after another,
into sane recollections. He now distinctly recalled
the part in the ugly intrigue played by the
woman; how she had skilfully led him on to
make advances; how she had smiled encouragingly
at his terms of endearment; how she had
&#8220;fished&#8221; for dubious compliments, and how
she had, above all, so alluringly made the most
intimate confidences to him as to her marital
troubles and as to her status of a <i>femme incomprise</i>.
Really, he thought after quiet reflection,
he himself was not so much to blame in this
affair, disgraceful as it doubtless was when all
was said and done. For the woman herself, a
change of feeling took place simultaneously.
The tender pity he had felt for her in his maudlin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
condition made room for something akin to
contempt and dislike. She certainly could not
be a pure woman, a faithful wife and mother, he
thought, thus to invite, almost provoke, the
passionate regard of a man much younger and
less experienced than herself,&mdash;a man, too,
whom she had known but slightly and conventionally
hitherto. In his inmost consciousness
he had almost absolved himself from guilt in the
matter. And as to writing to her husband, or
confronting him with the raw tale of her and
his indiscretion, as Borgert had suggested, why,
the more he thought of it, the less advisable a
step it seemed to him, from every point of view.
However, a promise was a promise, and he
would keep it.</p>

<p>He donned his full regimentals, and issued
forth at the right time for a visit of the kind.</p>

<p>He did not find Kahle himself in, he being
still away at squadron drill. But his wife flew
to meet him as soon as the parlor door had
closed behind the announcing servant, and her
reception was indeed such an affectionate and
even enthusiastic one that the words of penitence
perforce died on his lips. She drew him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
toward her on the low lounge, and exuberantly
babbled on about the comfort, the delight his
confidence had brought her. There was not the
slightest word said by her to show that she had
disapproved his approaches now that the glamour
of the moment, the enervating effects of close
communion in the warm air of a spring night,
were gone. Coquettishly she plied all her wiles
to captivate poor Pommer anew. His pulses
hammered, his senses were aflame; but he remained
master of himself, and sternly he resolved
to sever these equivocal relations with
a woman whom he could no longer respect.
The weak, purblind man had been steeled
against further temptation by seeing a few hours
ago the abyss yawning at his feet, in which an
illicit love had threatened to engulf him forever.
The image of his mother, noble type of womanhood,
rose before his mind, and he remained
strong.</p>

<p>Frau Kahle, on her part, at last becoming
convinced that all her arts were thrown away
on this iceberg, suddenly changed her tactics,
and dismissed her visitor in somewhat abrupt
fashion. She swept from the room, leaving him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to find his way out. Only the intoxicating perfume
which she used by preference lingered a
moment longer in the close air of the room as
the lieutenant sought his way out; but despite
a curious feeling of defeat which he could not
help instinctively feeling, there was subdued
exultation in his heart. His brow was serene
as, at the next crossing of the street, he encountered
Borgert, who hailed him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Pommer,&#8221; he shouted satirically,
&#8220;how is your headache? And how did you find
things at Kahle&#8217;s?&mdash;everything forgiven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, everything forgiven,&#8221; answered
Pommer, demurely, without going into any
further details.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent. Was a wise thing for you to do
to take counsel with an elder comrade, my dear
fellow. Well, I am glad for your sake everything
ended well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thanks to you,&#8221; said Pommer; and the
two shook hands and parted.</p>

<p>Pommer went home, well satisfied with
himself.</p>

<p>He fancied that all was now over between
him and Frau Kahle. His acquaintance with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
women of her stamp had never been extensive,
and to read the soul of one so utterly false and
grossly sensual as this inveterate coquette, was
quite beyond the ability of Lieutenant Pommer,
analysis of his own or anybody else&#8217;s character
not being his strong point.</p>

<p>He had, however, miscalculated Frau Kahle&#8217;s
fascinations over his unsophisticated self, and
decidedly underestimated her craving for admiration.
He was made aware of this when he
next met her, on the day following. She greeted
him with a smile so bewitching and a half-expressed
sense of intimacy so flattering to his
<i>amour propre</i>, that he was unable to resist.
Soon these two became the talk of the little town.
No matter if Pommer, looking at his inner self
within the quiet retreat of his own bachelor
quarters, bitterly bewailed his renewed fall from
grace, her influence over the coarser fibre in
his being easily triumphed over his qualms of
conscience.</p>

<p>He frequently met Borgert during this period,
but the latter, far from training once more on
him the battery of his eloquence, contented himself
with some facetious remark or with a Mephistophelian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
grin. And for Kahle himself, he
was probably the only one in the garrison&mdash;as
is the fate of husbands too often in such
cases&mdash;who was not in the slightest aware of
the &#8220;goings-on&#8221; of his nominal partner in the
joys and sorrows of life. And, besides, his tasks
as chairman of the Casino&#8217;s house committee
kept him, together with his official duties, practically
away from home all day long, and frequently
far into the night.</p>

<p>Pommer was, as we have seen, not precisely
of delicate stuff, either bodily or in his psychic
makeup. But the chains he was wearing nevertheless
galled him, and he not seldom man&#339;uvred
with his charmer to obtain release; but
all in vain. More than once he thought seriously
of writing to Captain Kahle himself, confessing
his guilt, glossing over her own share of it,
and offering all the reparation in his power.
That would mean, of course, exposing his own
precious life to the unerring bullet of the captain;
but even that outlook appeared to him
preferable to his present life of deceit. He now
regretted that he had not followed, the morning
after the Casino hop, his first impulse of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a clean breast of it to Captain Kahle. Thus
weeks dragged on, and there was no prospect
of a change in a situation which gradually
became intolerable to him.</p>

<p>But suddenly, without his having done anything
to bring it about, the day came that
granted him escape from his degrading entanglement.
The imperial order arrived, promoting
him to the grade of First Lieutenant and
transferring him to another garrison, far in
the interior of the country.</p>

<p>She was the first person he informed of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell! We shall not see each other
again!&#8221; He spoke quite coolly, almost callously,
and he left her cowering on the sofa and
weeping hysterically. He felt a free man again.
The abominable shackles had fallen from him.</p>

<p>If he had seen Frau Kahle five minutes after
he had left her he would not even have retained
for her a vestige of that first tenderness that had
swept over him that night in the Casino garden.
For when he had retired, and she had heard
his step on the flagging of the hall below, she
had quickly risen and peered, from behind the
lace curtains, into the street after his vanishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
figure. Then she had sat down at the piano and
intoned a merry Strauss waltz.</p>

<p>But then she reflected that they might call her
heartless. So she had indited a long, passionate
farewell letter to him. He showed it, the night
before his going, to Borgert at the Casino. They
were all his guests that night. Borgert had
screamed with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a devilish smart little woman she is,
after all,&#8221; he had exclaimed. And then, poising
in mid-air his champagne glass, he said, nodding
to Pommer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to her and her simpleton!&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke from experience.</p>

<h3>THE CASE OF SERGEANT SCHMITZ</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ate</span> in the forenoon of a raw day in
autumn Vice-Sergeant-Major Roth was
seated in his comfortably heated room, and near
him Sergeant Schmitz. Each was enjoying a
cup of coffee.</p>

<p>The quarters occupied by Roth were situated
on the second story of the regimental barracks,
and made at first sight the impression of
elegance and almost wealth, precisely as though
the occupant were a member of the upper ten
thousand.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It required a closer examination to
become convinced that a good deal of these
apparently costly trappings, as well as the furniture
and wall decorations, was not what it
seemed, and that, to produce by all means the
effect sought for, taste and appropriateness had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>been sacrificed. The wall paper of arabesques
in green and blue, which the government had
furnished, did not harmonize with the hangings
or carpets. The paintings on the wall were
cased in heavy gilt or oak frames, so unskilfully
placed as to conceal in spots the very wall itself.
Above the scarlet plush sofa hung a reproduction
of Lenbach&#8217;s &#8220;Prince Bismarck,&#8221; and to right
and left of it abominable oil chromos representing
horses. Against the opposite wall stood
a piano in stained oak, showing glittering silver-plated
candelabra. Neither Roth himself nor his
worthy better half, formerly saleswoman in a
shop, possessed the slightest knowledge of the
art of manipulating such an instrument. But
there was a story connected with this showy
piece of furniture&mdash;a story that even now, years
after the events themselves occurred, brought
tears of rage to the eyes of the &#8220;Vice.&#8221; To
the young corporal of his own squadron who
on Sunday afternoons strummed on the piano,
he used to say in pathetic accents, that those
&#8220;one year&#8217;s volunteers&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> had treated him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>most outrageously; and from his own point of
view he was probably right.</p>

<p>During the first year of their married life the
&#8220;Frau Vice-Sergeant-Major,&#8221; full of a sense
of her new dignity, had painfully felt the lack
of an &#8220;upright&#8221; or, better still, a &#8220;grand,&#8221;
inasmuch as she regarded such an instrument
as an irrefutable evidence of belonging to the
higher walks of life. She asserted, besides, that
in her girlhood she had received instruction on
the piano,&mdash;an assertion which nobody was able
to dispute because that period lay about a generation
back. She admitted that she had forgotten
whatever of piano playing she might ever
have known; but she felt quite sure that a piano
in her parlor would restore the lost nimbus, and
then&mdash;perhaps the most potent reason of all&mdash;the
wife of her husband&#8217;s &#8220;colleague&#8221; in the
second squadron owned a piano, and had taken
great care to let her know the fact soon after
she had become Frau Roth.</p>

<p>Roth himself, probably under the influence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>of his partner&#8217;s urgings, had frequently and
with due emphasis spoken to that year&#8217;s crop
of &#8220;one year&#8217;s men&#8221; about the great musical
talents of his wife, now, alas! lying fallow for
want of a piano of her own, and he had coupled
these remarks with plaints that the smallness
of his resources prevented the purchase of such
an instrument. These remarks, coming from
one who had it virtually in his power to obtain
for each one of the &#8220;one year&#8217;s men&#8221; promotion
after the fall man&#339;uvres, had at last borne fruit.
One day the aforesaid stained oak piano had
been unloaded at Roth&#8217;s door, accompanied by
a round-robin from the volunteers themselves,
in which they waxed duly enthusiastic over
his wife&#8217;s imaginary musical proficiency. Of
course, the supposed gift had been accepted, and
of course every one of the supposed donors
was advanced in rank the following autumn,
due to Roth&#8217;s brilliant testimonials of their
prowess and exceptional fitness for a higher
grade.</p>

<p>Roth never saw these &#8220;one year&#8217;s men&#8221;
again, but about a week after their departure
from the regiment a cart stopped before his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
door, and the driver said he had come to take
the piano back to the factory, the term of pre-paid
hire having expired. Decidedly a dirty
trick on the part of these young fellows, all
the more so as Frau Roth had by this time
bragged so much about her piano to every one
of her female friends and neighbors, to whom
she had represented it as a belated wedding gift
from a far-away uncle! The couple agreed it
would never do to return the instrument to
the makers, and thus it was that the Roths were
still paying for this piano in monthly instalments,
one &#8220;gold fox&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> each time, a number
of years afterwards, with quite a long time yet
to run. No reasonable person will blame Vice-Sergeant-Major
Roth for the aforementioned
tears of rage.</p>

<p>Hanging above the piano, one could admire
a huge steel engraving of Vernet&#8217;s &#8220;Funeral
Banquet,&#8221; also in an expensive frame (the gift
of a parting young soldier, son of a wealthy
farmer); while antlers, Japanese fans, a peacock&#8217;s
tail, etc., helped to produce a somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>incongruous <i>ensemble</i>. There was a pretty mahogany
stand, on the various shelves of which
stood a large china punch-bowl, six green Rhine-wine
glasses (both gifts from other &#8220;grateful&#8221;
recruits). There was also a solid oak writing-table,
on one corner of which Frau Roth had
stood the cages for her canary birds, just then in
the interesting stage of breeding, and therefore
voiceless. A huge portrait of the Kaiser, with
two crossed sabres and a pair of pistols under
it, and a cuckoo clock were exhibited on the wall
close by. There was also a big flower table,
but on near view it was seen that its fine roses
and tulips had not originated in a hothouse, but
under the scissors of an artist in tissue paper.</p>

<p>On the floor were to be seen two white goat-skins
and three small mats of domestic make,
as well as a genuine Kelim (gift from &#8220;one
year&#8217;s men&#8221;), and a thick plush table-cover,
as well as plush draperies, helped to make an
impression which, combined as it was of so
many ill-fitting details, was far from the one
intended.</p>

<p>Glancing at the lowering sky through the
east windows of this room, big, shapeless clouds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of gray could be observed slowly driving along;
it looked, in fact, like a cheerless and stormy
ocean, monotonous in its uniform tint. Now
and then showers of cold hail or rain tore away
from this chaos, and, pitched hither and thither
by howling winds, swept across the town or over
the desolate fields.</p>

<p>When the rain thus whipped the window-panes
and the boisterous west wind whistled
and roared in the stove-pipe, it was, by very
contrast, all the more comfortable in this warm,
cosy room, where one felt like humanely pitying
the poor comrades, now far out on the parade
field, drilling for dear life in the open.</p>

<p>This was the time of year when the regiment
ordered into a shorter or longer term of renewed
active service its reserve men, who were then
temporarily quartered in the sheds and loosely
constructed pavilions erected behind the barracks
proper. At such a time and in such
weather it was by no means pleasant to be out
on the drill grounds for the space of a whole
afternoon, and then, returning, to find one&#8217;s
quarters cold, dripping with rain; and to stand
shivering in clothes and boots thoroughly soaked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Those corporals and sergeants detailed for the
instruction of recruits under the roof of the big
barracks hall, and those told off for stable or
other indoor service, were well off in comparison.</p>

<p>For the non-commissioned officers generally,
however, and especially for Roth, there was
profit connected with the annual recall of the
reserves; for it meant increased pay, and it
meant a great increase in pickings of every kind.
Roth had been detailed as sergeant-major for
the first reserve squadron, and he was glad of it.
There were among these reserves a number of
men he knew to be &#8220;flush&#8221; of money, and
whom he understood how to handle. There
were also some &#8220;one year&#8217;s men,&#8221; who, nearly
all of them, had open hands and well-filled
pockets. By shutting an eye, or maybe both
sometimes, thus easing the severe discipline for
them, he was sure, at the end of their brief term
of supplementary service, to have the larger
portion of their &#8220;gold foxes&#8221; in his own pocket.
Roth was, therefore, with such prospects before
him, in the best of spirits. He was likewise in
a confidential mood.</p>

<p>Schmitz was &#8220;foddermaster&#8221; of the fourth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
squadron and detailed to the reserve squadron
for the time being. He was a very competent
man. Whoever wished to convince himself of
that needed but to visit the horses belonging to
his squadron. He would have seen them with
silky coat, round in limb, and full of dash and
life, standing above their fetlocks in the clean,
shining straw. His stable, too, was always a
model of neatness and cleanliness. Even the
walls were always well whitewashed and the
grated windows shining. Sergeant Schmitz, in
fact, made a labor of love of his duties.</p>

<p>When he went down the main aisle of his
big stable, and then turned and walked between
the rows of his smooth-coated darlings, it was
amusing to see these animals, all of them at once
recognizing his step, his voice, his touch; how
they turned their heads around, whinnying and
glancing affectionately at him if he called to
one or the other of his favorites.</p>

<p>There was, for instance, Clairette, a charming
little roan, which followed him like a dog, and
with her nostrils forever sniffed at his pockets
for sugar, and then rose on her hind legs or
lifted her left foreleg beggar-fashion. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was the &#8220;Ahnfrau,&#8221; a dainty little horse,
though old as the hills, with a coat black as
sloes, and which because of long faithful service
and because of the shrewd wisdom that
comes with age, was in favor with the whole
regiment and was often fed some sweet morsel.
The special pride of the foddermaster, however,
was the &#8220;twelve Chinamen.&#8221; They had been
bought in China, had then gone through the
campaign against the Boxers, had had their
share in the capture of Peking, and had then,
at the close of the Far Asiatic War, been enrolled
in the regiment. They were fine, powerful
horses, with shining coats and strong bones,
even if some of them did not reach the height
of &#8220;Peiho,&#8221; &#8220;Woo,&#8221; and &#8220;Kwangsue,&#8221; but
were, strictly speaking, but ponies. Each one
of the horses had its special claim on the
affections of this man who now sat chatting
with his &#8220;Vice&#8221; at the table.</p>

<p>Just then Frau Roth entered, carrying a tray
neatly covered with a snowy napkin, on which
stood a bottle of fragrant Moselle wine, three
glasses, and a narrow box of cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil! You&#8217;re living high, Roth! I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wish I had such easy times myself. What&#8217;s
up?&#8221; said Schmitz, in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my birthday anniversary but once
a year,&#8221; remarked Roth, sententiously, &#8220;and
on such occasions it&#8217;s worth while spending
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>His wife poured the wine into the green
&#8220;R&ouml;mer,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and each of the three raised a
glass of wine whose delicious, flower-like perfume
and whose straw-yellow color told them
that this noble grape-juice had been distilled by
the sun on one of the favored hills rising steeply
along the banks of the upper Moselle. Then
they cried, &#8220;Prosit&#8221; and clinked, so that the
fine glass emitted a bell-like sound. Then they
sipped with the air of connoisseurs. The little
scene was an unconscious imitation of similar
ones they had often noticed the officers of the
garrison enact with a certain solemnity. In
wine-growing countries they enshroud with a
time-honored ceremonial the ceremony of drinking
wine of quality.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>The two men lit their cigars, each bearing the
well-known narrow band of a famous importing
firm, and next they refilled their glasses.
They had another hour until the time for the
evening stable service should come, and there
was nothing to do meanwhile, for First Lieutenant
Specht, temporarily in command of the
reserve squadron, never appeared during the
afternoon service. Hence, there would be no
disturbance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be off on leave at Christmas?&#8221;
asked Roth of his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know yet,&#8221; Schmitz replied, with a
shrug of his shoulders. &#8220;I should like to, for
I haven&#8217;t been outside this dirty hole of a
town for two years; but it is hardly worth
my while to undertake such a long trip for
the few days, for I don&#8217;t suppose I should get
more than a week off, and it takes me forty-eight
hours to reach my home&mdash;it&#8217;s at the
other end of the world, you know&mdash;and that
much to return. So I should have but a couple
of days to myself, after all my trouble and
expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the fare?&#8221; asked Roth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;About thirty marks, and I haven&#8217;t that much
to spare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roth laughed disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a trifle only! Ho ho ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can laugh, of course,&#8221; retorted
Schmitz, good-naturedly. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t mean
anything to you. But suppose you haven&#8217;t got
that much money, what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lend you that trifle,&#8221; said the &#8220;Vice,&#8221;
pompously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you must have been winning in the
lottery, old friend! You&#8217;re spending money
like water for some time past. Every short
while you&#8217;re making a run into town; you&#8217;re
smoking genuine Havanas; and you&#8217;re even
ready to lend money! At the very least you
must have come into an inheritance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mine is not dead men&#8217;s money,&#8221; Roth
sneered. &#8220;All it takes is to be shrewd and
to gather up all the money that crosses your
path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve slain a rich Jew!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Not precisely,&#8221; said Roth, mysteriously.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t catch your meaning,&#8221; put in
the other.</p>

<p>Roth winked at his wife and then at Schmitz,
to show that she was not to hear his confidences;
but when she rose immediately after, to fetch
another bottle of wine, he said in whispers:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, if you want to know; but&mdash;&#8221;
he put his index finger significantly to his mouth&mdash;&#8220;Mum&#8217;s
the word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course; don&#8217;t be afraid. I never
betray my pals!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I will tell you. This is the
second time I am in command of the reserves.
Last time we had a whole lot of one year&#8217;s
volunteers amongst them, mostly well-to-do
farmer boys. You remember &#8216;Fatty&#8217; Kramer,
that swine, and Rossbach, whose father at home
has twelve horses in the stable, and Scheller,
the fellow who was always running after the
girls, and that whole crowd? Fellows of that
sort, you see, don&#8217;t know what to do with
their money, and I wouldn&#8217;t be such an ass
as to give them their pay, their uniform allowance,
and so on; they don&#8217;t care about those
measly few coins. Scheller, besides, gave me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a chance to make some money outside of that.
The last night before he had finished his two
years, I happened to inspect his quarters, it
being considerably past taps. And what do I
see but this very fellow, Scheller, together with&mdash;well,
you know&mdash;and as I was just about to
raise the deuce, he whispers in my ear: &#8216;Don&#8217;t
say anything, please!&#8217; Well, then, I kept my
mouth shut, and at noon the following day there
was a &#8216;blue rag&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in my overcoat pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce you say! What luck! But supposing
these fellows afterwards give you away,
especially if they don&#8217;t get their promotions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they won&#8217;t say anything; they are glad
enough if they can stay away from the army.
As to promotions, most of them were not the
kind to think about such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I in your place should be afraid there
might be trouble some time, and then think what
a rumpus there would be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me alone for that. Just now there
are a couple more of these rich, stupid fellows;
there is the son of a butcher in Brunswick whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>father must be worth a million or so, and the
others, too, have lots of money to burn. What
do you suppose I&#8217;ll make out of them before
they leave the squadron? They are worth at
least a couple of hundred apiece to me. Well,
<i>Prosit!</i>&#8221; They clinked glasses.</p>

<p>The glasses rang out harmoniously, and the
next instant they were emptied of the last drops.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like this stuff? Costs six
marks the bottle! Of course, <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t pay for
it,&#8221;&mdash;with another wink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horribly expensive; where did you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last year, you remember, that one year&#8217;s
volunteer, Hoch? When he wanted to become
sergeant, I did my best for him with the Chief,
and so he got the chevrons. And he was not
ungrateful. A whole box of wine&mdash;two dozen
of these bottles. Pretty decent, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lucky, sure enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, my friend, how these things must
be done. Always practical: that&#8217;s my motto.
Last year, for instance, I had charge of the mess
provisions. The butcher put in a good many
bones now and then, and I don&#8217;t think that he
ever gave over-weight. Naturally, I was after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
him, and the result was a &#8216;blue rag&#8217; every week
from him, and my family meat didn&#8217;t cost me
a red, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roth broke into a hearty laughter. He
slapped his pocket jocularly, and the jingling
sound of gold and silver met their ears. Then
he gulped down another glassful of the delicious
wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you drink, Schmitz? I suppose
you are full.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that, no; that takes longer. <i>Prosit!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>In this style the conversation proceeded, and
when they had emptied their third bottle it was
very evident that they had drunk about as much
as was good for them. Their eyes had assumed
a glassy stare, and their faces were scarlet.
Moreover, their speech was loud and blustering,
and Roth, particularly, was unable longer to talk
coherently, except with difficulty.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked at the clock. &#8220;Six, by
thunder. Time to look after the stables!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s go,&#8221; said Schmitz; &#8220;we must
get to the stables, the beasts are hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>They arose reeling. Roth girded his loins
with his sabre, and both of them went clattering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
down the stone stairs of the barracks. The sabre
struck the steps all along, as Roth descended
heavily, and there was a terrific noise.</p>

<p>Several soldiers stuck out their heads as the
two went along; and when they noticed their
intoxicated superiors they quickly retreated into
their own rooms, saying: &#8220;They surely have
enough! If one of us went about in that way
we&#8217;d be ripe for a pretty long term in the
cooler.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the turn of the corridor Dietrich, a good-service
man belonging to the fourth squadron,
stepped up to Roth and said: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask
the Herr &#8216;Vice&#8217; for some coal for Room X.
My men have been out in the rain foraging, and
all of us are wet to the skin. It is very cold
upstairs, and unless we can heat the stove our
clothes will not dry till to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Coal? Go to the quartermaster,
you loafers; I haven&#8217;t any coal for you!&#8221;
spluttered Roth with a heavy tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;The quartermaster has gone to town, and
the Herr &#8216;Vice&#8217; keeps the keys to the cellar in
such cases!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of my way, you &mdash;&mdash; fool! You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
don&#8217;t need coal every time a few drops of rain
fall. Lie down in bed, you pack of swine, if you
are cold, and leave me alone with your impudent
complaints.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dietrich stood for a moment in doubt, not
knowing whether it would be safe to make
another rejoinder. But he saw plainly that the
&#8220;Vice&#8221; was in an irresponsible condition, and
so silently, but with rage in his heart, he turned
on his heels so that the spurs jingled, and went
back to his men.</p>

<p>In the stables hardly anybody remained, the
men having attended to their duties and retired.
Only the stable guard was to be seen.</p>

<p>For stable guards men are taken, by preference,
whose health has suffered in the hard service
at this inclement season. One of them had
incipient consumption, the regimental surgeon
having noticed the man&#8217;s condition only a week
after his joining the squadron, and now the
colonel thought it was not worth while discharging
the man. The second one of these reserves
had, since his civilian life, nursed himself so well
as to have acquired a regular paunch, so that the
quartermaster had been unable to fit him with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
any of the uniforms, and the man, put into a
soiled canvas suit, had been permanently assigned
to stable duty. The third of this interesting
trio was something of an idiot, hailing
from the Polish districts. He grinned like a
maniac, and he was entirely unfit for drill or any
other kind of service that required even the
faintest degree of intelligence; but, having been
laborer with a Polish peasant, he knew how to
handle horses and to clean the stable. He
addressed, in his broken German, everybody,
including the officers, as &#8220;Thou,&#8221; and doffed his
cap in token of military salute.</p>

<p>The foddermaster felt frightened when he
became aware that feeding time was already
considerably past, for he regarded the horses
under his care with great affection. He therefore
called up the stable guards and hurried
them with a &#8220;Quick, now, you lazybones!&#8221; The
fodder wagon was loaded with oats and chopped
straw and then pushed into the main aisle of the
stable. The creaking of this vehicle was for
the horses the most joyful music every day. As
soon as the sound struck their ears they became
lively, raised their heads, craned their necks, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
turned around, as far as their halters would permit,
to watch the operation. They evidently
had thought themselves forgotten to-night, and
there was a keen edge to their appetites, so that
some of them became a little unruly, kicking,
neighing, and nipping at their neighbors out of
sheer sportiveness. &#8220;Napoleon,&#8221; the ancient
stallion, had been devoured by such an acute
sensation of hunger that as soon as the fat guard
aforementioned came near him with the measure
he tore it out of the man&#8217;s hands and gave him
such a push against his paunch that the guard
dropped the oats and, pressing both hands
against the injured part, ran out into the aisle.</p>

<p>Roth, watching things, saw this incident, and
shouted to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, you lazy lubber, pick the stuff up
again! Your fat carcass won&#8217;t be damaged by
such a little blow!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat individual, however, made no move
to obey, but continued to hold his paunch, while
tears of pain stood in his eyes, and his face
assumed a livid hue. Roth strode up to him
and began to belabor him with both fists, showering
hard blows on neck and head. Then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
grasping him by the throat, Roth turned the
man&#8217;s head around and administered such a
well-aimed blow on his nose as to draw blood.
Under this punishment the ungainly soldier rose
with difficulty, then bent down and began to
collect the overturned oats. Roth, however, in
his drunken fury gave the man a kick with his
heavy boot, sending him against &#8220;Napoleon,&#8221;
whose hind legs he embraced in an effort to
maintain his equilibrium.</p>

<p>But that was more than &#8220;Napoleon&#8221; would
stand. First he didn&#8217;t get his oats, and then
such practical jokes! He struck out with both
hoofs, hitting the poor devil of a guard against
some of the most sensitive portions of his anatomy,
and hurling him into the aisle like one dead.</p>

<p>Roth was frightened. Fortunately for him
nobody had seen the incident, for Schmitz, with
the other two men, happened just then to be busy
at the other end of the stable. So he merely
called the other two reserve men, and made
them carry his unconscious victim to the reserve
quarters close by. The whole business, though,
was very disagreeable to him, for the poor fellow
had been hit hard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first lieutenant the next morning
asked why the injured man had been taken to
the hospital, Roth answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was too clumsy in handling the horse,&mdash;frightened
it, and the beast naturally struck
out. I understand he has got a good-sized hole
in his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beastly fool,&#8221; scolded the officer.
&#8220;By rights the fellow ought to be put in jail
besides, as he will only spoil our horses.&#8221; But
that was the next morning. On the evening
in question, as soon as the accident had happened,
Roth felt in worse temper than ever.
He looked around for some one on whom to
vent his spleen.</p>

<p>He looked in the fodder chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the rest to &#8216;Zeus&#8217;; he hasn&#8217;t got quite
enough, and he looks as lean as a goat,&#8221; he said
to Schmitz.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Schmitz retorted; &#8220;he won&#8217;t get any
more. He has got enough&mdash;more than is good
for him,&mdash;and this morning he struck out and
hit a man. The horses are getting crazy, standing
all the time in the stable and munching their
oats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, give it to him anyway; he can stand
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? It&#8217;s nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>Roth had a new access of fury; nothing
enraged him as much as to be contradicted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him the rest, I say!&#8221; he said roughly
to Schmitz.</p>

<p>But Schmitz shut the lid of the chest and
answered shortly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad when I can save some fodder!&#8221;
And with that he pushed away the cart.</p>

<p>Roth, quite beside himself, shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sergeant Schmitz, you will not carry out
my orders? I shall report you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In saying which he left the foddermaster
in a huff, went with uncertain steps and with
black mien through the stable to his own quarters,
drank a big glassful of raw spirits &#8220;to
quiet his nerves,&#8221; and then threw himself full-clad
on the bed.</p>

<p>The two guards in the stable, who had observed
these occurrences with considerable interest,
stuck another handful of hay in front of
each horse, and then lay down on the straw in
the corner of the stable to sleep. Sergeant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Schmitz, however, went to his room, completely
sobered.</p>

<p>The following noon the orderly transmitted
to the reserve squadron of the regiment a document
reading as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h4>REPORT</h4>

<p>On the occasion of the stable service last night
Vice-Sergeant-Major Roth gave to Foddermaster Sergeant
Schmitz a formal order, which the latter did
not carry out. When the said Vice-Sergeant-Major
Roth emphatically repeated the order, the aforementioned
Schmitz refused once more to comply therewith.
This happened in the presence of the stable
guards, and it is charged by the aforesaid Roth that
Sergeant Schmitz was at the time in an intoxicated
condition.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 5em">Specht,</span><br />
<i>First Lieutenant and Squadron Chief</i><br />
<span style="padding-right: 1em"><i>of the 2d Reserve Squadron.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>The foddermaster happened to be seated at
his noon meal, when the sergeant-major stepped
up, announced his arrest to him, and took
him to the lock-up. There he was to remain
until sentence should be pronounced in his case,
for his offence had been officially designated
as &#8220;Peremptory refusal of obedience in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
presence of men assembled.&#8221; As such &#8220;men
assembled&#8221; the two guards of the stable were
regarded in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p>The incident was reported from mouth to
mouth throughout the regiment, and by far the
greater majority were indignant at Roth&#8217;s
action. Even the officers themselves declared
unanimously that such a superior as Roth ought
to be got rid of.</p>

<p>But Roth thought he had done something
heroic, and seemed great in his own eyes. When
off duty he declared he liked comradeship, and
was ever ready for a good joke, not taking
offence at anything. But when on duty, why,
the devil, they should see that he was not to be
trifled with. Every species of intimacy or
friendship was at an end when on duty. Then
it was: I order, and you have to obey, else I&#8217;ll
break your neck!</p>

<p>And Sergeant Schmitz all this time was in
his gloomy, cold cell. Lifeless and broken in
courage, he was staring at the rough stone flagging
through the long hours of the day. He
thought he was dreaming, and could not or
would not believe that he was behind lock and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
key because of a military offence. Why, he had
nine long years of service behind him, in which
he had conducted himself blamelessly, never
having been punished for a day.</p>

<p>Slowly, indeed, the seriousness of the situation
dawned on him, and with this consciousness
grew up a violent hatred of the man whom he
had deemed his friend, and who now, under the
influence of alcoholic rage was about to destroy
the fruits of all his life and those he had counted
to garner in the future. But he would show
the regiment, once he was a free man again,
what a low character the fellow really had, and
how behind his hypocritical and insinuating
manners were concealed systematic dishonesty
and fraudulent practices. Nobody should be
deceived by him again. He, Schmitz, would
take care of that.</p>

<p>That he was to be court-martialed seemed to
be beyond question. And as a matter of fact
he was charged, as he knew, with &#8220;peremptory
refusal to obey&#8221;; but the trial must certainly
show that the peculiar circumstances of his
offence were of such a character as to deprive
it of all seriousness, and that really there had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
been but an exchange of words which, although
an official character might be attributed to it,
could not possibly be viewed with great severity
when once all the facts had been established.
He counted, of course, among these facts his
intimate intercourse with Roth; but this point
would have to be clearly and skilfully brought
out at the trial, for on that hinged the issue.</p>

<p>Sergeant Schmitz prayed, therefore, formally,
in a petition to the regiment, for legal
counsel, and at the same time for permission
to enter with such counsel into oral and written
communication.</p>

<p>He was amazed when informed a few days
later that legal counsel could be provided by
military courts only in those cases where the
defendant was accused of a crime. On the
other hand, the communication said, there was
no objection to his retaining a suitable lawyer,
but of course at his own expense.</p>

<p>But where get the money for such a lawyer?
Schmitz&#8217;s slender means and those of his parents
at home were by no means sufficient for the
purpose, and yet he felt that he had no chance
in his defence if he were to face the judges of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the military court, and Roth himself, whose
persuasive powers of language he knew so well.
He would be unable, with his very insufficient
command of language, to enlighten the court
in an impressive manner as to intimate details.
Somehow, therefore, the money must be raised.</p>

<p>After three weeks of preliminary confinement,
the term was at last fixed at which the
trial was to take place. Schmitz felt that he
could await its issue with a clear conscience.
Even his counsel had told him that an unfavorable
end was not to be expected, as soon as
the judges had been made acquainted with
the circumstances preceding the actual trifling
occurrence in the stable. Schmitz expected,
therefore, that the term at which he was to be
tried would also be the day of regaining his
liberty; for the last few weeks, what with suffering
from hardships, from the insufficient and
coarse jail diet, and from worry, had been terrible
ones indeed for him.</p>

<p>Even the formal indictment drawn up against
him, of which a copy had been sent him, could
not repress his hopes. He knew that in such a
document everything concerning him and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
offence was naturally represented in the darkest
colors, so as to leave the judge-advocate sufficient
grounds on which to bring the proceedings
against him to the point of actual trial.</p>

<p>The document read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Proceedings have been opened against Sergeant
Ferdinand Julius Schmitz, on motion to that effect,
because of an offence against Paragraph 94 of the
Military Criminal Code.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although the defendant maintains that he has
been on particularly friendly terms with Vice-Sergeant-Major
Roth, that would in no way justify him in disobeying
an order issued while in the performance of
duty. On the contrary, his refusal to obey two peremptory
and emphatic orders, given in the presence of the
stable guard, and therefore before men assembled, was
a most glaring instance of insubordination.</p>

<p>&#8220;The excuse of defendant, that he was in an excited
condition by reason of indulgence in alcoholic
liquors, in nowise exculpates him. The circumstance
that his offence has been committed while intoxicated
during the performance of his duty, is rather
an additional reason for increasing the measure of
his punishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Defendant will be tried by court-martial.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>That sounded indeed very dangerous, just
as if he were a criminal of the deepest dye,&mdash;he,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
who for nine years had conducted himself
blamelessly. He was almost tempted to laugh
at this accusation, which seemed to him so
strongly tinctured with prejudice.</p>

<p>On October 20th, at noon precisely, the trial
began.</p>

<p>The judges had come to town from the seat
of the command of the army corps. With faces
severe and forbidding, they sat at a long table,&mdash;a
major, a captain, a first lieutenant, a judge-advocate
to conduct the proceedings according
to the statutes, and a second one to conduct the
prosecution.</p>

<p>After Schmitz had given an intelligent account
of the facts, Roth was called as witness.
He represented the affair in the most glaring
colors, denied all friendship with the defendant,
and likewise denied in the strongest language
that he also had been intoxicated, as Schmitz
had stated. By hook or crook he had gained
over as witnesses for his sober condition on that
evening the invalid afflicted with lung trouble,
and likewise the Pole. The latter, because of the
semi-idiotic state of his mind, and because of
his insufficient knowledge of German, he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
instructed to simply nod his head to all the
questions asked him. As luck would have it,
it so happened that the questions put to this
witness were of a kind to which his mute nods
were the answers most unfavorable to the defendant.
The wonder was, however, that the
court made no objection to such testimony.
Finally the &#8220;Vice&#8221; swore, with a voice shaken
by no tremor, to the truth of his deposition.</p>

<p>This, of course, was an unexpected turn in the
affair. Schmitz had not expected, and he had
not forearmed himself against such a tissue of
lies. His hopes sank considerably when he
noticed that the major, as chairman of the commission,
was shaking his head in grave disapproval
on hearing the unfavorable testimony.</p>

<p>Next followed the address of the prosecuting
judge-advocate, which conformed in almost
every detail to the substance of the act of
accusation.</p>

<p>Then Schmitz&#8217;s counsel arose. In eloquent
words he described the event as it had actually
occurred, weighed the peculiar circumstances,
and pointed with great emphasis to the former
intimacy of accuser and defendant,&mdash;an intimacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the existence of which had been corroborated
by several witnesses who had deposed
during the preliminary stage of the case.
Lastly, he made as much as he could out of the
fact that the whole occurrence had been an
outgrowth of a friendly birthday celebration.
In consideration of all these things, and also
because of the irreproachable conduct of the
defendant for so many years of active service,
he moved for his acquittal.</p>

<p>The court-martial then retired for deliberation,
and a long time elapsed before its members,
wearing a severe aspect, reappeared in the
session chamber.</p>

<p>Schmitz was in a dazed condition when he
heard the sentence: two months of jail!</p>

<p>He saw his life destroyed. In vain had been
the long years which he had given, at the sacrifice
of his best strength, to his country. His
dream of a future free from care, and of an
appointment, after another three years of service,
to a municipal office of an humble kind in
his native town, had been shattered at one blow.
What would his parents say, his sisters and
brothers, and what would become of the girl to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
whom he had been engaged for several years
past?</p>

<p>A fierce rage seized him, and he could have
throttled on the spot the man who by perjury,
out of vindictiveness and for selfish reasons,
had marred his existence forever. The blood
rushed to his head as he saw this same man
striding past him now, a sneer on his lips, in
haughty indifference. Nay, worse, he heard
the commander of the regiment say to this dishonorable
scoundrel:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right, Roth. Unpitying in the
service is what I want my non-commissioned
officers to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmitz was taken to a fortress on October
21st, where many hours of mental torture and
many days of hard, grinding labor of the lowest
kind awaited him.</p>

<p>Thus gradually approached Christmas time.
The wide yard of the barracks was covered
with snow. All lay desolate, lifeless, and grim
in the severe cold which had supervened during
the last days.</p>

<p>A large part of the regiment had been granted
holiday leave, and every one of the men did his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
utmost while on duty, in order not to forfeit
at the last moment the joys of home and friendship
which awaited him.</p>

<p>Almost every evening the members of the
corps of officers rode to the neighboring city,
there to make Christmas purchases; for only
one of them intended to go home for the holidays,
and the others were preparing a little
celebration at the Casino for which mutual gifts
were being chosen.</p>

<p>Borgert and Leimann both returned from
their divers trips, heavily laden with packages.
They bought everything that pleased them. It
might be that at some future time they would
somehow have the money to pay for it all.
Meanwhile every tradesman continued to give
them unlimited credit.</p>

<p>After making their purchases, the officers
usually met in a certain restaurant, where they
broke the necks of a few bottles of good wine.
And often it would happen that they boarded
the midnight train, being in a decidedly animated
mood, returning to their garrison.</p>

<p>One night Lieutenant M&uuml;ller, the regimental
adjutant, found an official telegram on his reaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
home, and was obliged, despite the late
hour, to go to the chief clerk of the regiment,
in order to talk over its contents.</p>

<p>There had been a heavy fall of snow, and the
keen east wind drove the snowflakes in a wild
dance through the cold air. It was all one
could do to recognize the path.</p>

<p>M&uuml;ller, who did not like being disturbed at
such a late hour, continued grumbling to himself
all the way to the barracks. Whenever he had
taken more than was good for him he was in
a quarrelsome mood, and in such a case he
usually made trouble. His comrades claimed
that he was suffering from megalomania.</p>

<p>Through the thick snow M&uuml;ller saw the illuminated
windows of the guard house, and inside
the small detachment of men were peacefully
slumbering.</p>

<p>The officer <i>du jour</i> had already visited them,
and the men had now made themselves comfortable,
discarding their sabres and helmets,
contrary to the regulations, and, dozing in their
chairs, had covered themselves with warm
blankets.</p>

<p>Private R&ouml;se had mounted guard outside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
He stood, shivering in the cold air, holding his
sabre in his fist, barely able to maintain his
martial attitude without freezing on the spot.</p>

<p>His thoughts dwelt in his far-away home,
with his parents and brothers, whom he expected
to meet again at Christmas, after a long
term of separation. His people were well-to-do
farmers, and his affection for the horses,
cows, and plump pigs under his father&#8217;s roof
was as sincere as that for the bipeds. He pictured
to himself all these pets, and was speculating
as to what he was to do in the shape of
amusement during the holidays, when he was
suddenly scared by the shout:</p>

<p>&#8220;Guard!&#8221;</p>

<p>R&ouml;se pulled himself together and quickly
glanced all around him in the gloom; but he
was unable to discover the owner of the voice.
Another similar shout reached him, and then at
last he saw dimly in the driving snowflakes a
figure approaching him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you present arms, you swine?&#8221;
bawled the regimental adjutant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I humbly beg the Herr Lieutenant&#8217;s pardon;
but I did not see him coming in the snowstorm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut your mouth, you lying beast; you&#8217;ve
been sleeping. I have been waiting an eternity
for your salute; but I will show you, you hog,
what punishment awaits a fellow of your
stripe!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he passed the sentinel, and the
latter was almost paralyzed with fear. Arrived
at the regimental headquarters, M&uuml;ller made
the following report:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The sentinel keeping guard between twelve and
two o&#8217;clock this night I found asleep during an inspection
which I made. He answered my call only
after a considerable time. I must declare in advance
that the man, in case he should urge his inability to
recognize me in the dark, is stating what is not true,
since I noticed particularly that he was asleep.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This report he placed on the desk of the commander
of the regiment. Then he aroused the
regimental chief clerk from a sound sleep in
the adjoining room, kept that poor fellow shivering
in his night garments in the corridor for
about ten minutes, and then went home. Having
discharged what he considered a grave duty,
he was able to sleep the sleep of the just.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the afternoon of December 22d, Sergeant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Schmitz returned from jail.</p>

<p>The poor fellow had greatly changed. The
black moustache, formerly twisted and waxed
so as to describe an angle in exact imitation of
the Kaiser&#8217;s, was drooping, and his face was
pale and worn. He looked shyly at all the privates
whom he met in the streets, and when
one of them saluted him, he deemed it a special
act of courtesy. He thought he read in everybody&#8217;s
eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;This man is a criminal,&mdash;a man punished
for grave insubordination!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reported himself to the chief of the
squadron, the latter said, with some show of
feeling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, my dear Schmitz, that I have to lose
you. You were always a man of whom I felt
proud, and who did his duty as few others did.
But the colonel has commanded me to cancel the
capitulation agreement<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and to dismiss you forthwith.
Console yourself with the thought that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>you have become the victim of a dirty intrigue.
I wish you well, and if I can be of any service
to you, you know where to find me. And so,
farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmitz felt the tears spurting from his eyes,
as his chief went towards the stable. His captain
was really sorry to lose him. Schmitz had
always been one of the pillars of discipline in
the squadron, and now this train of misfortune
had removed him and plunged him into misery.
It was a most unfortunate thing.</p>

<p>Schmitz went to the sergeant-major, who
gave him his papers and the fifty marks due
him. The sergeant-major, too, felt sorry for
him. He gave him a fervent shake of the
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any further claims on the regiment,
Schmitz?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the man&#339;uvres last year I&#8217;ve been
suffering with rheumatism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t tell me about that, Schmitz,
at the time, and considerably over a year has
elapsed since then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t report it then because I did
not want to disturb the run of things by my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
absence. I knew the captain was bothered a
good deal at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, that is all very well. I will report
your statement at once to the regiment,
but I&#8217;m afraid it will be too late. Meanwhile
you had better deliver up all the regimental
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Schmitz went up to his room, packed
all his things, and put his private belongings in
a small trunk. But before doffing his uniform
he went to the neighboring city and purchased
for himself a civilian&#8217;s suit, a collar, and a hat.
These took about all the money which had been
paid him.</p>

<p>Then he carried everything of the government&#8217;s
outfit to the quartermaster, to whom he
likewise sold some of the private regimentals
he had bought with his own money. The sabre
he kept as a memento.</p>

<p>And then came the hardest of all,&mdash;the farewell
from his comrades and his horses. Every
one had a friendly word for him, for he had been
a good comrade and had never been puffed up
with his own importance. Many a mute pressure
of the hand told him that they all felt sorry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for him, and that they, as much as he himself,
thought the treatment to which he had been
subjected an act of injustice. The privates, too,
pressed up to him to say a word of good-bye.
Often he had berated them soundly, but they
all knew him as a decent fellow, and as one who
had never badgered them unnecessarily.</p>

<p>As the noon service drew towards its close,
Schmitz went into the stable. What a pang for
him! Never in his life had a thing seemed so
hard to him. All the beasts he loved so well
turned and craned their necks towards him,
leaving the savory hay and their oats for a
moment as soon as they heard his voice, and
gazing at him with such intelligence as if they
appreciated his woe to the full. The sense of
desolation almost overpowered him.</p>

<p>He had filled his pockets with sugar, and he
began with &#8220;Clairette,&#8221; feeding the sweet morsels
to all his quadruped friends. &#8220;Clairette&#8221;
lifted her forefoot, begging for one more piece.
He laid his head against the velvety neck of the
animal, stroking caressingly the silky nostrils
and around the fine eyes, then kissing her on
the white spot just below. The mare seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
understand him. She whinnied softly, and gave
him a sad glance of parting. Next came old
&#8220;Marie.&#8221; How much longer would she be able
to stand the service? And thus he visited them,
one by one, in token of farewell. The last one
was &#8220;Napoleon&#8221;; but even he showed to-day
no trace of his accustomed ill temper. He gave
the strange man in civilian clothes a long look
of doubt and forbearance.</p>

<p>A last, lingering glance to his hundred darlings,
and then he painfully suppressed a tearful
sob, and climbed up to his late quarters to get
his trunk.</p>

<p>There he met the sergeant-major of his
squadron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your invalid claims, Schmitz, have been
disallowed. The colonel says you would have
had to make a report at the time. Now it is
too late. Just as I thought. Here is something
for you,&mdash;the bill of your attorney, who has
asked the regiment to collect the amount due
him. It&#8217;s a matter of sixty marks; and if you
are unable to pay it he threatens to seize your
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmitz had almost forgotten about that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Within an hour I shall have the money,&#8221;
said he, after reflecting a moment.</p>

<p>Then he went down to the city and entered
the store of a watchmaker. He laid on the
counter his watch and chain and asked in a firm
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you give me on this? I need
money!&#8221;</p>

<p>The watchmaker examined both, and then
said, with something of a sneer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty marks. That is all I can give
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmitz calculated silently. He still had
thirty-five, and twenty more made fifty-five. So
he needed another five marks. He removed a
ring from his finger, a little gift from his
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this worth to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten marks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, give it to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmitz pocketed silently the two gold pieces,
then went to the barracks, paid the sergeant-major
the sixty marks, and took his trunk away.
He was just in time to catch the evening train.</p>

<p>Those who saw this pale, downcast man, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
his small trunk, seated in the car, scarcely supposed
that he was until recently a royal Prussian
sergeant, dismissed in disgrace from long service
because of a small offence, without a penny,
but with rheumatism in all his bones, and with
his patriotism destroyed, thrust into the street
to seek a new and precarious means of living,
after spending his best strength, his health, and
his youth in the service of his country.</p>

<p>On the summit of the hill, whence he could
discern the barracks, the snow glistening on its
roof, he cast a last look at the spot where he
had spent so many years. He raised his arms
with a threatening gesture, and a curse escaped
his lips.</p>

<p>In the train which carried him off there were
numerous soldiers of his regiment, singing and
joking, on their way home for the holidays.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve had come. All the world&mdash;thousands,
millions&mdash;were happy. They felt
the charm of this most beautiful Christian festival,&mdash;a
day which moves to softness the
hardest hearts. But Schmitz, an outcast, felt
nothing but bitterness and shame. His glance
dwelt on the lighted windows where all these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
happy people were celebrating, and he vowed
vengeance.</p>

<hr />

<p>Friedrich R&ouml;se meanwhile occupied a badly
warmed cell, undergoing a fortnight&#8217;s confinement
because of his alleged inattention while on
duty as sentinel.</p>

<p>Through the narrow window of his cell he
could espy the quarters occupied by the third
squadron, a couple of stories higher, in the same
building; the row of windows was shining with
the brilliant lights of a gigantic Christmas tree,
standing in the centre of the large hall. The
sounds of a pathetic Christmas hymn were floating
down to him, as it was intoned by the throats
of the men. Shivering with cold, he sat on the
edge of his hard pallet, and a tear rolled down
his cheek. Again his thoughts dwelt with his
friends at home, far away, and wrath filled his
soul.</p>

<p>What disillusionment the year had brought
him since he had begun his term as volunteer!
His father, once sergeant-major in a regiment of
Guard Cuirassiers, had often described to him
a soldier&#8217;s life in vivid colors, and had expressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
his hope to see, some day, his boy himself advanced
to the grade of sergeant.</p>

<p>But that prospect was now gone. His punishment
brought with it as a consequence the impossibility
of ever rising from the ranks.</p>

<p>His one-time zeal for his calling had changed
suddenly to a violent distaste for everything
connected with the service. At one blow the
enthusiastic, ambitious recruit had turned into
one of the many soldiers who serve in the army
simply because they are compelled to do so, and
who are longing for the day when they will be
able to doff the uniform forever.</p>

<p>And why all this?</p>

<p>Not because he had knowingly neglected his
duty, but because one of the officers, one of the
men whom he had until recently looked up to
as demigods, had in his drunken spleen selected
him for a victim. And that which this officer
had maintained in his report had to stand as an
absolute fact, no matter how untrue; and if he
or anybody else should express doubts of its
accuracy it would mean a new and punishable
offence.</p>

<p>In answer to the questions asked by the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of his squadron, R&ouml;se had stated the occurrence
quite truthfully, and had assured him solemnly
of his innocence. But the adjutant had replied
to this that the man wanted to exculpate himself
by untrue statements. The report was, therefore,
accepted as it read.</p>

<p>Was it to be expected that M&uuml;ller would
admit his own wrong, admit that he had in
his semi-drunkenness misinterpreted the facts,
and that he had been in an unpleasant frame of
mind at the time? Of course not. That would
have meant charging himself with an offence.
How could he, the infallible regimental adjutant,
own up to an error? No, he was never
mistaken; and what difference did it make, anyway,
if this raw recruit did get a fortnight&#8217;s
term in the &#8220;cooler&#8221;?</p>

<p>What difference?</p>

<p>This difference,&mdash;that there was now one
more of those who proclaim that the private
soldier in the German army is a man forced
into a yoke, the prey of every whim of his
superiors, a man exposed to the bad humor of
those above him, one who has to suffer, without
a sign of resistance, undeserved harshness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
injustice. Such a man was now this young
recruit.</p>

<p>And what further harm was there in it?</p>

<p>This,&mdash;that everybody in the future, when
R&ouml;se should be asked for his testimonials, would
shrug his shoulders, thinking: &#8220;This man cannot
be trustworthy, for he has undergone severe
punishment for neglect of duty as a sentinel,
and that is a bad sign!&#8221;</p>

<p>Towards nine o&#8217;clock in the evening R&ouml;se
was aroused from his sombre reflections by a
rattling of keys at his door. The key turned in
the lock, and in stepped the officer on duty,
making his round, behind him the guard.</p>

<p>R&ouml;se jumped up, assumed a rigid military
posture, and reported himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Private R&ouml;se, sentenced to a fortnight&#8217;s
confinement for neglect of duty while on
guard!&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer cast a searching glance into the
dark cell, trying to make out whether he could
discover a forbidden object in it beside the
blanket and the water-pitcher, and then he turned
to go. But R&ouml;se hesitatingly and in humble
tones said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Will the Herr Lieutenant permit me to
make a respectful request?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask the guard if you want anything,&#8221; answered
the officer shortly, and then descended
the stone steps, his sword clanking.</p>

<p>The corporal on guard then turned and went
back to R&ouml;se&#8217;s cell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you want?&#8221; he asked, with a
show of good-nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know, Herr Corporal,
whether a letter from home has arrived for me,
and whether I could not have it!&#8221; answered
R&ouml;se, shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my boy,&#8221; laughed the corporal,
&#8220;strictly speaking, that is something not permitted&mdash;first
serve your sentence, then you
can find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as he scanned closely the features of
R&ouml;se, who was of his own squadron, and whom
he rather liked,&mdash;noticing the melancholy face,&mdash;he
felt pity for the poor fellow. It was really
a hard thing to spend Christmas in jail for what
probably was a mere oversight, or for what,
according to R&ouml;se himself, he had not even
committed. Therefore he said pleasantly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will inquire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He locked the door, and sent a man to R&ouml;se&#8217;s
quarters with a request to the corporal there to
call on him. When the man came over he asked
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a letter for R&ouml;se?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter? No, but a package has come for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you!&#8221; whispered the corporal.
&#8220;Open the box and bring something of the contents
over here. I feel sorry for the poor devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded and disappeared, soon to
return with a letter that he had found inside
the package together with some dainty eatables.
The corporal took it all and brought it up to
R&ouml;se, and then he told a man to carry up a
pail of coal to the cell.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the sheet-iron stove was
aglow, and sent waves of warmth into the cold
cell. R&ouml;se stood in front of it, and by the flickering
light of the flames he slowly perused the
letter of his parents. While he read tears were
streaming down his face. Then he hid away
under his pillow the other treasures,&mdash;a sausage
and a cake,&mdash;wrapped himself into his blanket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and lay down to sleep. In his dreams R&ouml;se
was standing beneath the Christmas tree, and
around him were his dear ones at home.</p>

<p>The twenty-eighth of December was a day
of mourning for the fourth squadron.</p>

<p>All the men, including those who had just
returned from leave, gave the last escort to a
dead comrade. It was Dietrich, the good-service
man, who was carried out to the cemetery.</p>

<p>He had always been of a weakly constitution;
but he had been seized by a violent fever
the day when he had returned, overheated, and
wet to the bones from rain, after hard drill on
the parade ground, and had had to spend the
evening and the night in a cold room, because
Roth had refused to furnish coal. Two days
later the surgeon of the regiment established
the fact that inflammatory rheumatism had
supervened, and this had taken so bad a turn
within a short time that the heart had become
affected. On Christmas Day the poor fellow
had died.</p>

<p>His parents had been summoned by telegraph
to attend the funeral of their only son;
but sickness in the family and other circumstances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had prevented their coming, and thus
the funeral took place without a single friend
or relative being present.</p>

<p>The day afterward the fat reserve man, the
one who had been injured by &#8220;Napoleon,&#8221; left
the hospital. His injuries seemed healed; but
the whole face was horribly disfigured by livid
marks left from the sutures of the surgeon&#8217;s
needle, and the left eye had been removed by
an operation, since it had been feared that the
other eye might also be lost unless prompt and
radical measures were taken.</p>

<p>Maimed and crippled for life, the man returned
to his home, discharged from the army
for physical inability. A monthly pension of
nine marks had been &#8220;generously&#8221; allowed him
by the government.</p>

<hr />

<p>Schmitz, the ex-sergeant, on New Year&#8217;s Eve
sat in a scantily furnished room.</p>

<p>To earn a living, even if but a very poor one,
he had been forced to take work as a common
laborer in a large factory of the neighboring
city. He had engaged board in a tenement
house, with the family of a fellow-workman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>There he sat now, his head buried in his
hands. On a plate before him were the remnants
of a frugal supper, and a small lamp with
broken chimney threw a reddish sheen on his
immobile figure. Against the wall, above his
bed, were hung his sabre and its scabbard,
crosswise. On a small wooden stool stood a
bowl, in which he had performed his ablutions,
and a soiled towel hung from it. The fire in
the small stove had long ago died down, and
but a few coals were still glimmering feebly.</p>

<p>To see the man one would have imagined him
asleep; but Schmitz was very much awake, and
in his head wild thoughts were whirling. He
was thinking of times past and gone; and the
more his present circumstances contrasted with
former ones, the more grimly rose his hatred
against the man who had brought him to his
present plight. He was planning his revenge,
ruminating deeply how best he should punish
the rascal, and how to brand him with a life-long
reminder of his infamous deed.</p>

<p>A while longer he thus sat, brooding darkly;
then he rose with clouded face and stepped to
the window. He breathed against the pane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
covered with rime, until a small space had been
formed through which he could peer out into
the open. He saw the dial opposite on the
church steeple, from which the bells melodiously
rang out in full-toned peals the closing moments
of the old year, and proclaiming the advent of
a new one.</p>

<p>Midnight. Schmitz seized his hat, clapped
it on, took his heavy cane into the right hand,
blew out the lamp, and cautiously descended the
dark staircase. On the ice-crusted step in front
of the housedoor he lingered a moment, listening
to the vibrations of the solemn bells. No
other sound was audible; no human step could
be heard&mdash;only the distant rush of air which,
like the breath of a gigantic being, told of the
thronged streets of a busy city.</p>

<p>Schmitz shiveringly turned up his coat collar,
sank both his hands into his pockets, and went
briskly, the cane under his arm, to the railway
station. There he bought a ticket for his former
garrison, but a few minutes away by rail, and
stepped on board the train which had just
rolled in.</p>

<p>Arrived there, he found the small town buried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
under a thick blanket of snow. From the barracks
row upon row of lighted windows glimmered
like stars from the distance. Every little
while snatches of song or single chords, wafted
towards him by the wind, gave sound in the
night. Far away the ringing of church bells
could be heard, coming not only from the
steeples of the town itself, but from the villages
and hamlets surrounding it,&mdash;a joyful greeting
to the new year. From out of the dramshops
and restaurants floated the sounds of
loud talking, laughter, and singing of merry
people, celebrating in hot punch the gladsome
hour.</p>

<p>Schmitz went fleet-footed towards the end
of the town where the barracks were situated.
But when he came to a restaurant in the vicinity
of the spacious building he made a halt.
Cautiously he peered into the gloom around
him, to make sure that nobody was near, and
then he climbed to the top of a wall and looked
intently into the lighted window below.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there sat Roth, a conspicuous
figure in a company of fellow-drinkers; for in
this place he habitually spent his evening hours,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
frequently far into the night, drinking and
playing at cards.</p>

<p>Then carefully and noiselessly he climbed
down and strolled on in the direction of the
barracks. He turned into a rural pathway, lined
on both sides by snow-capped hedges, and then
stopped at a certain spot. He knew that Roth
would pass him on his way home.</p>

<p>Schmitz had to wait a long while in the nipping
air, but his blood bounded tumultuously
through his veins; for his revenge, longed for
with all his heart, was close at hand.</p>

<p>The keen-edged wind drove particles of snow
before it and pricked his heated face like needle-points.
The dead leaves of a tall beech-tree
rustled over him, and he felt like a victor.
Patiently, triumphantly, he waited.</p>

<p>Down below, where the pathway opened into
the street, he now and then saw a dark shape reel
past and disappear in the night like a shadow, the
soft snow deadening the footfall. These were
jolly roysterers, returning from their carousal.</p>

<p>From the steeple, some distance away, came
the metallic voice of a bell striking the first hour
of the new year, and Schmitz reckoned on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
probability that his foe would soon wend his
way homeward.</p>

<p>But in this he deceived himself, for it was
close unto two o&#8217;clock when the &#8220;Vice&#8221; at last
turned into the lane. Schmitz could not be mistaken.
His sharp eyes, by this time habituated
to the dark, clearly made out the burly figure.
He grasped his cane firmly in his hand, and his
heart hammered in his bosom. Nearer and
nearer Roth approached, now but a few steps
away, his face almost completely hidden in the
upturned collar of his cloak; but Schmitz saw
the cruel, hard eyes, now dull and fishy from
excessive indulgence in New Year&#8217;s punch.
Roth was in a good humor, however, whistling
to himself and dragging his sabre at his feet,
walking with unsteady gait.</p>

<p>At this moment Schmitz stepped out from
beside the hedge, and, his cane on his shoulder,
he planted himself before the other.</p>

<p>Roth was startled, and looked keenly at the
man who stopped his progress. He did not
recognize him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you want?&#8221; He mumbled
thickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;To settle accounts with you,&#8221; was the brief
answer. At the sound of the voice Roth visibly
paled. For a moment the two stared at each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see, it is you, old fellow. And what
do you want of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what I want!&#8221; shouted Schmitz,
and with terrific force his cane came down on
Roth&#8217;s head. A second blow followed, almost
as hard, which hit him on the cheek, so that the
blood rushed out of the wound. The &#8220;Vice,&#8221;
taken unawares, made no motion to defend himself
while Schmitz rained a shower of strokes
on his body. Then at last Roth, wide awake
now, felt for his sabre, partly drawing it from
its scabbard; but Schmitz gave him no chance
to use it. Like a famished wolf he seized his
enemy by the throat, throttling him, and, dropping
his cane, with his clenched fist he dealt
him several fearful blows on forehead and
mouth, winding up with a tattoo that sounded
like the beating of a drum on the man&#8217;s skull.
A violent push made Roth stumble and fall to
his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, now, you miserable cur, I have paid my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
debt to you!&#8221; and saying which, he kicked his
fallen foe. Then he turned on his heels and
said, as a parting shot:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now go and report me again, you swine;
but if you do I shall have another reckoning with
you, and tell about some of your thieving!&#8221;</p>

<p>The former &#8220;foddermaster&#8221; felt that he had
meted out justice, and he was fully prepared
to take the consequences, no matter what they
might be. Revenge is a sweet morsel.</p>

<p>Roth had to spend several weeks in the hospital,
until he had recovered from his injuries.
It was the hardest drubbing he had ever received
in his life. Vanity forbade him to give a true
version of the assault. He reported that he
had been attacked by several drunken laborers,
and claimed to have used his sabre with effect
on one of them; but nobody believed his tale,
for no wounded laborer was heard of in the
little town, and physicians there and in the
vicinity were equally ignorant of such a case.
It was, therefore, generally assumed that Roth
had met with his deserts at the hands of the
ex-sergeant, and nobody pitied him.</p>

<h3>OFFICERS AT A MASQUERADE</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring</span> the last days of January the
Casino was in an uproar. A number of
mechanics, painters, and florists were busy
transforming the rooms and corridors, even the
veranda, with its adjoining conservatory, into
a suite of daintily decorated festal halls. Numerous
booths and tents were being erected, and
all other preparations were made worthily to
receive Prince Carnival, whose coming was timed
for the first week in February.</p>

<p>Hundreds of potted plants and orange and
laurel trees from the conservatory gave a gay
and summer-like appearance to the ballroom.
Placards painted and inscribed in suitable manner
hung from the walls. In the booths and
tents the usual array of eatables and &#8220;wet
goods&#8221; of every description could be seen, to
be sold by pretty womenfolk. One stage had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
been fitted up for variety performances, while
on another a circus was to be seen, in which a
number of private soldiers, disguised as wild
beasts, were to play leading parts under the
eyes and whip of the trainer&mdash;none other than
Captain Kahle. These men had been drilled for
the purpose throughout the whole month.</p>

<p>There was also a stretch of natural greensward,
laid down by the Casino gardener. This
was to produce the illusion of a small park.
Benches placed on it invited the guests to rest
and to enjoy the music of a band upon a suitable
stand, while Pilsen beer was to be handed to
the audience by waiters. In an adjoining room
mock marriages were to be performed, the fee
to the officiating justice of the peace to consist
in the purchase of a bottle of champagne. And,
to complete the scene, arrangements had also
been made to obtain a quick decree of divorce
(by the same official) for all those couples who
deemed themselves mismated after a short experience
of an hour or so.</p>

<p>The large dining-room represented picnic
grounds. On a platform wreathed in green
there was room for an orchestra, and the trumpeters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the regiment had been ransacking the
whole town for weeks in order to find ragged
costumes and discarded garments of every kind,
clad in which they were to represent village
musicians.</p>

<p>Even photographers were there, to ply their
trade in several tents, the outside of which
showed a collection of ludicrous portraits and
prints of various kinds. The purpose of this
stratagem was, of course, to attract customers.</p>

<p>Naturally all these festivities, planned for
weeks, formed the main topic of conversation
with the members of the club, and the whole
garrison was for the time being turned topsy-turvy.
Every one intended to appear in as
original and amusing a guise as possible, and
there was much mutual consulting and guessing
as to which particular r&ocirc;le was to be assumed
by each person.</p>

<p>Thus the opening night of the f&ecirc;te drew near.
During the afternoon a crowd of hairdressers
moved into the Casino, to assist members of
the club in getting themselves up properly. The
regimental tailor, with his aides, went from one
officer&#8217;s house to another, making alterations or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
needed repairs on the uniforms and costumes to
be donned.</p>

<p>At seven in the evening the orderlies, in the
black garments of waiters, were expecting the
guests and members, and half an hour later these
began to arrive in crowds.</p>

<p>It was a multi-colored, vivid picture, as all
these persons, many of them good-looking and
picturesquely attired, in all sorts of disguises,
began to move in the brilliantly lighted halls,
while the several bands, placed at coigns of
vantage, struck up lively and inspiring airs.
Dancing began at once, and champagne flowed
in streams. At a garden table under an orange
tree one could see a powerfully limbed peasant,
his hawthorn stick between his knees, devouring
a plateful of caviare, while his neighbor, a circus
clown, was dissecting a lobster.</p>

<p>The most ludicrous figure, however, was
Colonel von Kronau in his Polish farmer&#8217;s costume,
wearing a fur cap on his head, and a
tippet around his neck. If he had appeared in
this disguise at the hog market in a Pomeranian
town, every purchaser would have supposed him
to be the &#8220;genuine article,&#8221; namely, a breeder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of porkers. And it was quite evident that he did
not have to take much pains correctly to imitate
the manners and gestures of the person he
represented.</p>

<p>The champagne was paid for out of a common
fund specially raised by all the members of the
Casino. It was, therefore, not astonishing that
the Herr Colonel was, after the lapse of one
brief hour, deep in his cups.</p>

<p>His adjutant had not done well to disguise
himself as a Polish Jew, for in that way he
looked indeed too much his part.</p>

<p>Frau K&ouml;nig was charming as a chambermaid,
and her blue eyes radiated the pleasure she felt.
As a young gamekeeper, Lieutenant Bleibtreu
paid assiduous court to the aforementioned
chambermaid. He had already proposed to her
to visit the &#8220;marriage booth&#8221; in the adjoining
room, and the justice of the peace was getting
ready his paraphernalia. Only late at night,
when the captain, her every-day husband, carried
her home, did the pretty maid relinquish
her newer claims upon the gamekeeper.</p>

<p>Frau Leimann presented herself as a peasant
girl from the &#8220;Vierlande,&#8221;&mdash;a district near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Hamburg,&mdash;and her costume looked indeed
very picturesque, and became her well. Borgert
noticed this fact with great pleasure, and the
dainty figure and small nimble feet made a
strong impression on his susceptible heart.</p>

<p>Frau Kahle, as a flower girl, was flirting desperately
with the younger men. She also played
her part very well, for the champagne in which
she had liberally indulged began to exert its
effects. Lieutenant Kolberg, as a modish
dandy, had already purchased nearly her entire
supply of flowers, and when, soon after, the
remnant had gone, he claimed and obtained her
as his partner for the dance.</p>

<p>Frau Captain Stark alone did not seem to belong
in this <i>milieu</i>. The choice of a costume, to
begin with, had occasioned her deep and anxious
thought. She felt that to follow her inclinations
and appear at the masquerade in either the guise
of a ballet dancer or of a flower girl would too
markedly invite criticism. Her fifty years and
her towering shape would really have made her
too conspicuous in such parts. On the other
hand, to show herself as a peddler woman or
fishwife would have, so she feared, made her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
look &#8220;too natural.&#8221; Having, therefore, discarded
these notions, her fancy roved in the
realms of the beautiful and fantastic, until it
settled down upon a costume which, bespangled
and with its garland of rushes, she declared to
be that of a &#8220;mermaid of middle age.&#8221; Nobody
was in a condition to contradict her, inasmuch
as nobody recollected ever having seen a
&#8220;middle-aged&#8221; mermaid before. She floated,
as a matter of fact, in a cloud of pink and sea-green
laces. The capacious bosom this cloud
concealed from view rolled and heaved quite
realistically, thus producing the effect of ocean
waves, and her enormous arms were awe-inspiring
enough to keep away all evening those
in the crowd who had not got their sea-legs,&mdash;and
that meant practically all the younger
officers. At all other times her most dutiful
slaves, these young men seemed to have conspired
to leave the dreaded chief of the regiment&#8217;s
nominal chief severely alone. Of course
she felt this as an unpardonable offence, and this
all the more as the colonel at an early hour was
in an irresponsible condition, and hence listened
to her violent plaint with stolid equanimity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a male trio, too, that claimed some
attention. They represented to the life merry,
devil-may-care vagabonds, and so well did they
act their parts that one would have supposed
they had just been picked up on the miry highway
outside. They deemed it, of course, strictly
within their privileges to get drunk with all due
speed,&mdash;an endeavor in which they admirably
succeeded. From that hour on they became an
unmitigated nuisance, not even atoned for by
some humor or merry pranks. After midnight
they were always seen in a bunch, steadying
each other as they lurched along.</p>

<p>Lieutenant von Meckelburg, during the
earlier part of the evening, stuck resolutely and
almost silently to his assigned duty, it being
that of an organ-grinder. He had picked up
somewhere a villainous specimen of this instrument
of torture, and with it had retired into a
corner, wearing the ragged and faded clothes
of an impecunious veteran of the wars, with his
visorless, crumpled cap pulled over his eyes, and
with a face which for unadulterated melancholy
could not be duplicated. Hardly any one took
notice of him, and his physiognomy grew sadder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and sadder. At last, however, he left his organ
in its corner, and visited the various bars where
champagne could be had. With each generous
libation his features cleared, and finally he got
himself into a decidedly hilarious condition,
and not only moved with his organ into the
centre of the greensward, where he placed it
on one of the benches, but accompanied its
shrill and squeaking notes with a mellow
basso of his own.</p>

<p>The bands meanwhile played their best and
merriest, and as several casks of beer and some
dozen bottles of cheap spirits had been provided
for them, the members, both trumpeters of
the regiment and civilian musicians hired for the
night, devoted no inconsiderable portion of the
intervals between their playing to frequent and
prolonged visits to that small side-room where
these drinkables had been placed ready for use.
After a while they dispensed even with such
formalities. They rolled the remaining casks
up the steps of their podium, and shortly the
faucet could be espied from among the greenery,
and the musicians hovering about it. As a
matter of course, their playing soon showed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
effects of all this tippling. One man particularly,
one of the flageolets, became quite unmanageable,&mdash;or
rather the instrument on which he
was performing,&mdash;so that it usually was the
space of a second or two ahead of the others.
This weird music only ended with the removal
of flageolet and man from the scene.</p>

<p>At eleven began the festal performance on
the small stage constructed for the purpose.</p>

<p>One of the lieutenants led off with two topical
songs rather too outspoken in the lessons
they tried to convey. He was disguised as a
prima ballerina for the purpose, and as a windup
he danced, with great skill and abandon, a can-can.
The ladies tittered and the men guffawed.
After more of the same kind there was enacted
a parody on Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8220;Hamlet.&#8221; The
gentleman responsible for this version had employed
radical means to clear the stage of all
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, at the end. Murder, suicide,
poison, dagger, lightning even decimated
their ranks, and when the curtain dropped there
was not a soul of them left alive. The crowning
effect of this parody was the appearance of the
prompter himself before the footlights. In a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
few tear-choked words he informed the audience
that after seeing the actors all die, and nothing
but corpses around him, he could and would not
survive, and so he made an end of himself, too,
using a rope for the purpose.</p>

<p>The humor of the whole audience after that
grew rapidly boisterous, and by midnight the
tone of this carnival f&ecirc;te given by officers and
their ladies could scarcely be distinguished from
that rampant at a village kermess. If anything,
it was a trifle more unconventional.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kolberg had in the meantime
found a cosy arbor into which to retire with
Frau Captain Kahle, and more effectually to
exclude intruders had placed a tall screen before
the entrance.</p>

<p>A little &#8220;flirtation,&#8221; more or less serious, was
something he could not do without, and since
the garrison with its staid citizens and their
staider wives and daughters did not furnish the
material required for him, he had made up his
mind to lay violent siege to the heart of the
lady. He knew that it was a susceptible one,
and from Pommer he had heard, in hours of
bibulous intercourse, that siege in her case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
meant speedy surrender. He had already progressed
with her beyond mere preliminary skirmishes,
and in their conversations with nobody
near they had begun to use the intimate &#8220;thou,&#8221;
and to call each other by their given names.</p>

<p>For his purpose, then, no better time could
have been found than this very festivity, with
all the allurements which champagne, music, the
dance, and the hurly-burly of a huge crowd
afforded. Shielded against indiscreet spies by
the interlacing vines creeping all over this arbor,
his love-making had proceeded at such a rapid
pace that within an hour the little woman did
not thrust her gallant wooer aside when he
dared imprint a kiss on her swelling lips.</p>

<p>In another arbor, more in proximity to the
champagne bar, First Lieutenant Leimann sat
in lonely misery and shed rivulets of tears. His
intoxication, in its more advanced stage, always
took that form known technically as &#8220;howling
desolation.&#8221; On this occasion it had seized him
promptly after the ninth glassful.</p>

<p>His condition was in ludicrous contrast with
the magnificence and dash of his attire, for
he was dressed, regardless of expense, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Hungarian magnate of the first water, and he
rejected with sombre scorn all attempts made
by friends to commiserate him. His nearer acquaintances
knew for a certainty that he would
thus remain seated on top of an empty wine
cask until the very close of the ball. For whenever
the black devils of drink cast their spell
over him in this fashion it required from four
to six hours to emerge into a saner and somewhat
soberer frame of mind. Just now his sobs
shook his whole bony body. The divers orderlies
who passed him held their sides with
laughter, but he heeded them not.</p>

<p>His wife found the situation very annoying,
and she therefore resolved to get one of her
sudden attacks of headache. She retired, with
signs of disgust on her pretty face, to another
corner, and when Borgert joined her soon afterward,
she requested him in mellifluous tones to
escort her home.</p>

<p>As they reached the door of the house in
which she with her husband occupied the upper
part, while Borgert had his smaller lodgings
on the ground floor, she sighed with some satisfaction
and said in a low voice:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The air has done me good; I feel much
better now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then may I take you back to the Casino?&#8221;
was Borgert&#8217;s answer, and the tone of his voice
was full of disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, we will go up and have a cup of
coffee; that will do us good, and I really do
not feel like returning to that crowd of drunken
people; it is simply disgusting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as it pleases you, my most gracious
lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he inserted the key into the lock,
opened the door, and both of them silently scaled
the rather steep stairs, dark as Erebus.</p>

<p>When they had reached her cosy parlor, Borgert
brought the lamp and lit it. He knew
exactly the spot where he would find it in the
dark, for his acquaintance with every nook of
the apartments had come in the course of time
with their mutual intimacy. Then he took up
a newspaper and sat down in the sofa corner.</p>

<p>Frau Leimann had disappeared in the adjoining
room; but it took her only a very few
minutes to return, bearing in her hands the
Vienna coffee machine, and presenting, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that she had resumed a comfortable and coquettish
kimono in lieu of her masquerade costume,
a most seductive picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said she, letting the heavy window
curtains down, &#8220;now at last we are again where
we can have a comfortable, undisturbed chat
together.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>The first rosy dawn showed on the horizon as
a heavy, lurching step was heard on the stone
stairs outside. Frau Leimann blew out the
lamp, and then resumed her seat on the sofa,
leaning her head against the soft cushions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Leimann had noisily opened the
door leading into the corridor, and now stepped
into the room where his wife was waiting.</p>

<p>For a moment he halted at the door. He
thought he discovered the scent of cigarette
smoke. Then he felt his way towards the table,
found a box of matches, and lighted a candle.
Then he saw his wife recumbent on the sofa.</p>

<p>The sight touched him. Had this faithful
soul awaited his coming so long, in order to
offer him a cup of coffee? Doubtless sleep had
overtaken her, and she had not heard his step.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
So he cautiously approached her and imprinted
a kiss on her forehead.</p>

<p>A nervous cry escaped her, and she quickly
rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is you, Franz. Where did you stay
so long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be angry with me, my angel, that
I kept you awake so long; but I really never
dreamed that you would do this. Why did you
not retire long ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words sounded so full of affection,&mdash;almost
like an excuse, like a prayer for forgiveness,&mdash;but
they did not touch her; she
simply yawned with some affectation, and
stretched her arms as if dying for a sound
sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you know, Franz, that I had to wait
for you; you were again in a fearful condition.
When I saw you sitting in that way I felt so
miserable that I could bear it no longer, and
went home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone,&mdash;so late at night? Why did you
not have one of the orderlies escort you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Borgert took me as far as the door; he
offered to be my escort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to thank him for that to-morrow,
and, come to think of it, he is always
very attentive to you. Where did he go afterwards;
I never set eyes on him again the whole
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He complained of a headache, and seemed
to have had enough of the whole show. I suppose
he went to bed long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you offer him a cup of coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Franz, what would the servants think
if they heard me coming home with a gentleman
so late at night? That would never do. Our
maid, Marie, anyway, is listening and spying
continually, and one has to take care not to let
her hear things. I presume she has been telling
tales out of school as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send her away then, if you have no confidence
in her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have done it long ago, but I can&#8217;t
let her go until we have paid her wages. We&#8217;re
several months behind with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then pay her to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What with? Have you any money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? What an idea. You know perfectly
well that the few marks of my pay could never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
keep this household running. Hasn&#8217;t your
mother sent the allowance this month?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she hasn&#8217;t anything to spare this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&mdash;the old story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that meant for reproach? You knew
yourself that we were not rich. Do me the
favor, therefore, to spare me your hints and
complaints. I find them tactless and inappropriate
at this late time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you never want to hear about that.
You ought to have known before you married
me that to keep house without money is a beastly
nuisance. Now we have this ceaseless dunning
every day: one day it&#8217;s the butcher, the next
the baker, and the day after the laundress,&mdash;and
they all want money. I can&#8217;t cut it out of
my hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But wasn&#8217;t it yourself who kept on urging
and urging me until I promised to marry you?
Didn&#8217;t you gainsay all my objections and insist
on our marriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough; but you and your mother
ought to have known better. You never ought
to have consented, even if I was fool enough to
insist on it. Your mother knew how much it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
costs to keep house, and I didn&#8217;t. And now it
is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I know myself, and you needn&#8217;t drive
me crazy by constantly nagging at me. And
it isn&#8217;t my fault, either; for if everything had
turned out the way my mother desired, you
would not have had to complain to-day that
you are married to a woman without money.
You were not the only one from whom I had
proposals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you ought to have told me then,&#8221; replied
her husband, with an ugly sneer. &#8220;I&#8217;m
awfully sorry if I have interfered with your fine
prospects.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are more vulgar, Franz, than I
thought you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, women can never bear the truth.
If one doesn&#8217;t flatter you the whole time and
play on the tuneful lyre of love, you at once
begin to find fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t been surfeited with terms
of affection by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is merely because I don&#8217;t know how
you have deserved them of me. Is it perhaps
because I don&#8217;t know how to pay my shoemaker,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
or how to meet a whole bunch of bills that have
come in the last fortnight? Oh, what a fool
I have been! Instead of leading this dog&#8217;s life
with you, I might to-day attend the Academy of
War and lead a decent existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue, you vulgar brute; you
have no right to insult me! Leave my room, or
I shall leave the house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Instantly, and with the greatest pleasure,
my gracious lady! Pleasant dreams to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Leimann violently slammed the
door behind him so that the windows shook,
and then went to his own bedroom.</p>

<p>But his wife buried her face in the sofa
cushions and sobbingly sought relief in tears.
That gave a vent to her feelings of hatred and
rage against her heartless husband. Her whole
soul rebelled against this brutal man whom she
had married because he had sworn on his knees
to her that he could not live without her. And
now he roughly stamped into the ground the
affection which she once had borne him. He
desecrated all those recollections which are so
dear to a woman&#8217;s heart, and which at critical
points in her life are meant to be a stay and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
comfort, and to make the burden of misfortune
lighter to her.</p>

<p>And if, a short time before, when she had
hastily parted from Borgert, she had felt something
like remorse,&mdash;something of shame in
having abused the confidence placed in her by
her husband,&mdash;she now regarded herself as
a victim, and her fault only in the light of a
just revenge for his heartless conduct.</p>

<p>For at no time is the heart of woman more
susceptible to temptation than at the moment
when she feels herself betrayed and outraged in
her best feelings.</p>

<h3>A SENSATIONAL EVENT STIRS THE GARRISON</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was plain daylight when the last guests
left the Casino. Without exception, liberal
indulgence in champagne and brandy had done
its work, and the motley crowd that left the
building thus &#8220;early&#8221; was in a decidedly boisterous
mood, and the limits of decency and good
manners had been passed by them hours before.</p>

<p>The nearby church bell struck the hour of
seven as Captain Stark and his wife, as well
as the colonel and his better half, climbed into
the capacious vehicle that had been waiting for
them at the door of the club-house for several
hours. The horses had become stiff in the
joints, and, with a cold and raw blustering wind
to chill them, they were now forced to pull their
heavy load on the miry highway leading toward
town. The coachman had to use his whip freely
to make the poor beasts break into a sorry trot;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
but at last the human load had been deposited
before their doors.</p>

<p>Lieutenant von Meckelburg and First Lieutenant
Specht could scarcely keep on their legs;
but, nevertheless, they walked straight from the
Casino to the barracks, where they were to give,
each of them, an hour&#8217;s instruction to the recruits.
They quickly doffed their fantastic gear&mdash;the
organ had been left behind by the lieutenant;
but when they appeared before their
pupils the latter could scarcely suppress a shout
of laughter. For Specht had in his hurry forgotten
to remove his artificial moustache, and
this gave him such an unusual appearance that it
was only when his voice, somewhat shaken by
alcoholic excesses, met the soldiers&#8217; ears that
they felt sure whom they had before them.
The &#8220;instruction&#8221; he thus imparted was certainly
very far from enlightening their minds
on the duties falling to the share of a defender
of the fatherland.</p>

<p>Most of the other officers preferred, however,
a good long sleep, and simply ignored the work
of the day. It was only towards noon when the
first captain showed his face at the barracks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain K&ouml;nig and his faithful Lieutenant
Bleibtreu were, in fact, the only officers of the
whole regiment who attended to their duties in
the forenoon, they having gone home at reasonable
hours. Their principle was: first the work,
and then the amusement.</p>

<p>Captain Hagemann showed himself in the
streets, mounted on his favorite horse, as the
noon hour struck. He had not yet recovered
his equilibrium, and the horse seemed to appreciate
that fact instinctively. He carried his
master with such tender commiseration for the
condition of the latter that he picked his way
as carefully as if walking on ice.</p>

<p>Stark himself preferred to remain altogether
at home. His &#8220;Kater&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> was inexorable, and
demanded a long, unbroken rest to find its way
out of the muddled brain of its owner. His
place in the regiment was, as usual, filled by his
tireless lady. Holding her husband&#8217;s official
note-book in her hand, she went her rounds,
noticing the presence of all the men and non-commissioned
officers, and making a black mark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>against the name of Lieutenant Kolberg, as he
was absent without leave.</p>

<p>At 1.30 she received a visit from Hagemann,
who came to make most elaborate and humble
excuses because he had been audacious enough
to indulge in gibes at the expense of the doughty
lady during the ball. In fact, while in the enterprising
stage which forms so interesting a
part of the effects produced on human bipeds
by champagne, he had been bold enough to
pay her some strongly ironical compliments in
her capacity of &#8220;mermaid.&#8221; He had told her
incidentally that she was eminently fitted for her
part, as it was a well-known physiological fact
that fat kept afloat on water. Frau Stark, who
was proof at all times both against flattery and
against the insinuating allurements of the foamy
liquid, and who was as much matter-of-fact to-day
as she had been the night before, merely
deigned to accept these excuses with a small
nod and a dry &#8220;That will do!&#8221;</p>

<p>Leimann, on his part, likewise started out on
a tour of visits, the sole purpose of which was to
offer much-needed explanations and apologies
to nearly every member of the club whom he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
had offended more or less seriously during the
period of his &#8220;howling desolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Night had come, in fact, when the larger
number of the officers met at a solemn &#8220;D&auml;mmerschoppen&#8221;
at the Casino,&mdash;a process of
applying hair of the dog that bit you to cure the
injury. They discussed in voices still considerably
husky and thick the doings and misdoings
at the entertainment of the previous night.
Criticism was applied freely to everybody who
happened to be absent; but about Leimann
judgment was unanimous: he was a beast.</p>

<p>It was Borgert&#8217;s part to report to the assembled
&#8220;Corona,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in his inimitable manner,
about that part of the adventures of Kolberg
and Frau Kahle which had come under his
personal observation.</p>

<p>Nothing had escaped his lynx eye, and he
related with great gusto what he had not failed
to discover of the interesting proceedings in the
arbor. Even the protection of the screen had
not been sufficient to blind him.</p>

<p>While all these things were said about them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Kolberg and Frau Kahle were sitting near a
good fire in his room, enjoying the renewal of
their intimacy.</p>

<p>On pretext of necessary purchases, she had
escaped the vigilance of her husband, and under
the protection of the dark had hastened to that
end of the town and to the garden behind the
walls of which stood the small house inhabited
by Kolberg. Tall chestnut trees, throwing
their shadows over its roof, gave it additional
seclusion.</p>

<p>What was there really for her to make life
enjoyable? Aside from walks in the woods
nearby there was nothing to do for her the live-long
day, so that she felt it a positive blessing to
have, as often as circumstances would permit,
a cosy t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Kolberg. Her husband,
too, was not the kind of man a woman could be
happy with. Hard drinking and interminable
hours spent at the Casino were all he cared for.
The estrangement between him and his wife
had been almost complete even before Pommer,
and now, since his going, Kolberg had crossed
her path.</p>

<p>In this way passed several months.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The secret of the intimate relations existing
between Kolberg and Frau Kahle had slowly
filtered down into all the strata of society represented
in the little town, and they formed
even one of the regular themes of conversation
in the low-class dramshops on the outskirts
of the town where the laboring population
lived.</p>

<p>Even Kolberg&#8217;s comrades knew about it, but
none of them felt rash enough to undertake mediation
or interference in such a delicate matter
where the tangible proofs seemed not within
reach. It was to be expected, that if confronted
with the facts of the case as far as these were
palpable, both parties concerned would simply
deny the damaging allegation, and in such a
case the r&ocirc;le of the advising friend might easily
have become one of great difficulty. The accuser
might then have been charged with assailing
the honor of a lady of the regiment and that
of a fellow-officer. Such a charge, in the absence
of absolute proof, could have had but one
issue. For who could tell whether the sole witness
to some of the escapades of the two&mdash;that
is, Kolberg&#8217;s man&mdash;would stick to his statements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
as soon as he should see that circumstances
became serious? Perhaps&mdash;and that
seemed probable&mdash;he would entirely recant
from fear of punishment for having secretly
played the spy on his master. And suppose he
then represented the facts in a more harmless
light, who could gainsay him?</p>

<p>On the other hand, it was justly feared that
the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of this matter would raise much
dust, and lead to the resigning of one comrade,
to a serious duel, and to the disruption of another
comrade&#8217;s household. And as Captain
Kahle was rather popular with his comrades,
because of his open-handedness and his easy
good nature, nobody felt like opening his eyes
to the miserable intrigue.</p>

<p>Therefore everything remained as it was, and
only malignant gossip increased in volume, so
that Captain K&ouml;nig at last resolved to give the
commander of the regiment a hint of affairs in
a spirit of strict privacy.</p>

<p>But the colonel asked, as soon as the ticklish
subject was broached:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you report this to me officially? No?
Well, then, I don&#8217;t want to know anything about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
it. I won&#8217;t burn my fingers in meddling with
a matter of that kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>K&ouml;nig himself did not feel like becoming the
instigator of a most disastrous scandal. After
all, it was not primarily an affair where he ought
to take the initiative, and this aside from the
further consideration that he would probably
become involved in a duel by taking the lead in
exposing the guilty parties. He therefore also
made up his mind to keep quiet.</p>

<p>Thus it was that nothing was done by anybody
to put a stop to all this mischievous talk,
and to put out of the world a matter which was
of the greatest injury to the regiment and to
the whole corps of officers,&mdash;a matter, too, in
which the civilian population was perfectly justified
in pointing the finger of scorn at them.
And whereas in other circles, in civilian ones,
the guilty parties would under similar circumstances
have been called to account, in this instance
a state of things was permitted to exist
for a number of months which scandalized every
decent person who, while forced by social conventions
to meet the offenders on terms of
equality, would have entirely shunned them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
once proper steps were taken to conciliate outraged
public opinion. And this was all the more
reprehensible because it affected a caste which
deems itself superior to any other within the
monarchy, and which believes itself to be the
guardian of good manners and morals, and of
a high conception of honor.</p>

<p>The largest measure of blame necessarily fell
to the share of Colonel von Kronau. This
gentleman, at all other times ready to proceed
with stringent severity wherever he discovered
slight breaches of discipline or of the mechanical
details of drill, and who knew no clemency
where nothing was to be feared for himself
by playing the rigid taskmaster, in this instance
tolerated this shameful thing; for he knew
that interference in this particular would mean
for him, in any case, serious inconvenience.
Two things were possible. Either he would be
charged with falsely accusing others, or else his
position as commander would receive such a
blow as to make it perhaps untenable, once his
superiors should obtain knowledge of the actual
state of affairs within the regiment. Neither
of these contingencies was to his taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, therefore, with great relief that he
one day received the official notification of Captain
Kahle&#8217;s promotion to a majority, together
with an order of the latter&#8217;s transference to a
garrison in South Germany. That, then, meant
the longed-for end of this horrible business, and
he doubly rejoiced that he had not acted on the
spur of impulse; for he doubted not that, if
he had, the outcome would not have been as
favorable.</p>

<p>Kahle felt naturally greatly elated at his
unexpectedly rapid promotion. At last he had
reached the goal of his ambition. For many
years, ever since he had entered the army as a
beardless stripling, it had been his aim to attain
to a commanding position. And once up the
ladder as far as major,&mdash;the critical point in
the career of every German army officer,&mdash;he
could with confidence await further promotions
in the course of time; for he was not devoid
of talent in his profession, and had devoted
much serious study and research to its higher
spheres, although the benumbing effects of the
dissolute and monotonous life in the little garrison
had also had upon him decidedly deleterious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
effects. He had acquired drinking habits,
and his domestic peace had, as he was aware,
for some time suffered therefrom; but he felt
sure that amid new and more inspiring surroundings
he could pull himself together and
become once more his old self of former days.
Hence the new Major Kahle felt happy, and no
cloud disturbed his serenity. He was going to
a large and lively city, and both he and his wife
would reap the advantages of that. There was
quartered there a considerable body of troops
of various branches of the service, and his intercourse
would, in consequence, greatly widen,
and so would that of his wife. His income
would be much larger, and the social attractions
offered in the new place,&mdash;such as diverse entertainments,
concerts, a good theatre, and the
opera,&mdash;would do much to restore that sense
of contentment to his volatile spouse which she
had seemed to lack for long.</p>

<p>The day after his promotion had become
public,&mdash;a &#8220;Liebesmahl&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> assembled the entire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>corps of officers at the Casino. Specially to
honor the departing major, the colonel had
ordered full-dress uniform, and Kahle himself,
a man of tall and commanding figure, made a
fine show in all the glory of his orders, silver
tassels, and broad stripes.</p>

<p>After the second course the colonel arose and
made an impressive speech in behalf of the departing
comrade. In it he paid high tribute to
the new major&#8217;s popularity and to his eminent
military virtues. At its close he handed to
Kahle the usual silver tankard, bearing the
initials and insignia of the regiment.</p>

<p>Kahle was greatly moved by these tokens of
esteem, and he thanked the colonel in a short,
manly way. In his farewell speech the joy of
his promotion was the predominant note; but
there was an undertone of sadness at parting,
after so many years, from comrades and a garrison
he had known so long. Often, it is true,
he had sighed for a change, and there had been
a good deal of worry and annoyance in this
world-forgotten little town close to the French
frontier; but now, when the hour of parting
came, it cut him, nevertheless, to the quick to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
have to leave it all behind. Such is the weakness
and inconsistency of frail human nature.</p>

<p>Next day he left by the noon train, and the
officers were assembled at the station in full
force to bid him good-bye. Brief military leave-taking,&mdash;just
a shake of the hand and a word
or two. The colonel formally and affectionately
kissed him on the cheek, and then Kahle bade
leave to his wife and their little son. His heart
was heavy, and it cost him something to conceal
the tear which had stolen into a corner of his
eye. He had fully resolved to make his married
life hereafter a happier one, and to have once
more a real home. It was this thought in his
mind which made parting with his wife particularly
cordial. He trusted that she would rid
herself of those bad habits she had acquired
here, and that different environs would soon
sweep from her memory recollections of life
in this little town, where he and she had been
forced to spend the best years of their lives, at
the frontier, <i>quasi</i> outcasts of the empire.</p>

<p>Until arrangements could be made by him
for new and comfortable quarters in the garrison
he was going to, Frau Kahle was to stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
on here, and First Lieutenant Weil and wife
had asked her, to make things pleasanter for
her, to remain as a guest at their dwelling for
the short intervening time.</p>

<p>Joyfully Frau Kahle had accepted the friendly
invitation. Thus she would have occasion
thoroughly to enjoy herself with Kolberg until
the hour of separation from him should strike.
She felt with great relief that with her husband
away she had no longer to give an account of
her actions to anybody.</p>

<p>One day the Weil family were seated with
their guest at table, when a military servant
brought in a letter for Frau Kahle which the
carrier had just left. She opened it, rapidly
looked over its contents, and then put it away in
the pocket of her robe, her cheeks reddening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frau Pastor Klein is writing me to come
and take a cup of coffee with her this afternoon,
since she wants to see me once more before my
going,&mdash;amiable of her, isn&#8217;t it? I think I
will start at once, so as not to be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>She arose, and sidled out of the room with a
&#8220;Till this evening, then!&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Weil saw her hastening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
down the street in the direction of the
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange!&#8221; he then said to his wife. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think she ever associated with her before,
and scarcely knows her. I hope this is not one
of madame&#8217;s little tricks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her go where she will, Max,&#8221; retorted
Frau Weil, indifferently. &#8220;It&#8217;s none of our
affair. She will leave in a day or two, anyway,
and, after all, she is responsible for her own
actions.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Weil shook his head doubtfully and went
to his study.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantel indicated eight, and
Frau Kahle had not yet returned. They began
to fear anxiety on the score of their guest.
What could have happened to her?</p>

<p>The maid was just setting the table for the
evening meal in the adjoining room when the
couple were giving expression to their surmises,
explaining in one way or another this prolonged
absence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minna,&#8221;&mdash;Frau Weil turned to the girl,&mdash;&#8220;I
think you had better go to the house of Frau
Pastor Klein and ask whether Frau Major Kahle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
is still there. I shall have no rest until I know
what has become of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I shall find her at the Frau
Pastor&#8217;s, gracious lady,&#8221; replied the girl, &#8220;for
I saw the Frau Major up on the avenue, about
half-past four, as I was fetching the milk, and
the Frau Pastor lives right behind the church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case there is no use in sending there,&#8221;
and Frau Weil shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think my idea will prove the right one,&#8221;
said the first lieutenant,&mdash;&#8220;it was a mere
pretext on her part. She did not want to tell
us where she was really going. I have my own
thoughts about the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you think, Max,&#8221; his wife
asked, with some show of curiosity. &#8220;Where
else could she be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Kolberg, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can you say so, Max? I don&#8217;t suppose
she....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly she will! That is just what she
is doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both became silent when the servant girl
stepped in. She placed the teapot on the table,
and then took a folded piece of paper from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
pocket, and handed it to Weil with a peculiar
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has this perhaps been dropped by either the
Herr First Lieutenant or the gracious lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>And as Minna had again retired, the officer
first gazed at the paper with eyes wide open,
then he gave a scornful laugh and held it open
to his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, my dear, will you not convince yourself?
There it is in black and white.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Weil hesitatingly took the slip of paper
from his hands and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Am expecting you to-day at 4.30, since I shall be
engaged to-morrow in the service.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Signature and address were wanting, but the
writing was unmistakably Kolberg&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said Weil. &#8220;That is her way of
thanking us for offering her our hospitality,&mdash;just
lying to us, and trying to befool us for no
other purpose than to permit her to continue
her disgraceful conduct. Didn&#8217;t I at once say
it would be better not to have her come? But
you, of course, insisted on inviting her. If you
had listened to me, we should now be spared the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
disagreeable necessity of throwing that woman
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for heaven&#8217;s sake, Max, that you can&#8217;t
do. Throw the note into the fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind,&#8221; her husband
flared up. &#8220;I shall certainly throw her out of
the house! Or do you suppose I&#8217;m going to
make our home a convenient shelter for depraved
women? Let her see where she will
find another refuge. As for me, I respectfully
decline the honor of harboring her any longer
as our guest; and this note will not go into the
fire, but, instead, where it belongs,&mdash;before a
Council of Honor!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young officer was in a great state of
excitement. With rapid strides he measured
the room, burying his hands in his pockets. His
dark look betrayed indignation and resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will take my advice,&#8221; his soft-hearted
spouse said, with some trepidation, &#8220;you will
put that bit of paper into the stove and keep
quiet about the whole matter. She is to join her
husband in another two days, anyway, and then
there would be an end to her intrigues in any
case. Do me the favor, my dear Max, and leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
your fingers out of that pie, for there will be
nothing but disagreeable consequences awaiting
you if you don&#8217;t. And then, another thing,
think of the poor major!&#8221; And the little
woman had actually tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>But that stubborn husband of hers proved
inexorable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do what I said I was going to do,
and that&#8217;s all there is about it. These are matters
you don&#8217;t understand. I won&#8217;t quietly look
on while this person continues her miserable
intrigue with that scoundrel, Kolberg,&mdash;at
least not while she is in my house. She ought
to have had enough decency remaining to have
left off meeting him while being the guest of
honest people. That is beastly; it&#8217;s worse than
beastly,&mdash;hoggish, I may say!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Weil did not insist any longer. She
knew her husband, knew his strictness in such
matters, and also knew that the more she would
plead with him the more fixed his purpose would
become; but her forehead became rumpled with
unpleasant thoughts, and she sat down before
the glowing coal in the grate, in a brown
study.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Her husband meanwhile continued to pace
the carpet, reflecting on what steps he had best
decide.</p>

<p>At last the maid came into the room once
more, and said, with a mien of ill-concealed
curiosity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam is served!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us, Minna, where did you find that
letter?&#8221; said the officer to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found it lying in the hall under the hat-rack;
I presume it must have dropped out of
somebody&#8217;s pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; you may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently the couple sat down to table. Weil&#8217;s
face was clouded, and his wife scarcely looked
up from her plate. She lifted her glance to him,
however, with considerable anxiety when the
hall door was heard to open, and Frau Kahle&#8217;s
voice became audible.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is coming, Max! Now, for pity&#8217;s sake,
don&#8217;t make a scene! Think of the servants
who will be sure to listen and to spread everything
that&#8217;s said.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Weil did not answer, neither did he look
at the door when it now opened and gave admission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to the Frau Major. Her face was rosy
with excitement, and her eyes were gleaming
in humid tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, both of you!&#8221; she cried
gayly, her voice trembling with suppressed agitation.
&#8220;I hope you will pardon the delay;
but Frau Pastor Klein pressed me so much to
drive with her over to the city that I could not
resist, and that is how it became so late. But
it was delightful,&mdash;my afternoon with her.
We were at a caf&eacute;, and made a number of
purchases.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weil arose stiffly and faced his guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said he, with quiet dignity, &#8220;it
is useless for you to try to deceive us as to the
purpose of your absence this afternoon. The
letter which reached you while at table with
us, and which has come into our hands by accident,
proves in the most unmistakable manner
that you have abused our hospitality most
grossly. May I request you to leave this house
as soon as ever you can, but certainly no later
than to-morrow morning? I must beg that you
will leave us undisturbed for the remainder of
the evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He ceremoniously bowed, and then took his
seat once more at table.</p>

<p>Frau Kahle remained for a moment as if
petrified in the semi-obscurity of the room.
Then she hastily seized her ch&acirc;telaine bag. Her
hand tremblingly fingered its contents, and then
she turned to the door and went out, slamming
it behind her. The footfall of her retreating
steps could be heard in the direction of her
own room.</p>

<p>After supper the first lieutenant stepped up to
his writing-desk, lit the green shaded lamp, and
sat down on a stool before it. Next he selected
a large sheet of official note-paper, dipped his
pen, and leaned back and reflected.</p>

<p>For some time he thus concentrated his
thoughts, and at last began to write.</p>

<p>His spouse, meanwhile, with anxious aspect,
sat on the sofa near a small table, busy with
some embroidery, her fingers mechanically travelling
to and fro; but every little while she cast
a troubled glance towards her husband, whose
pen went scratch, scratch, over the paper.</p>

<p>At last he had finished the letter. Weil reclined
pensively in his chair, and slowly read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
over and over what he had written. He made
no alterations, but folded Frau Kahle&#8217;s note up
with his own, and then enclosed both in a large
yellow envelope, sealing it in the proper way.</p>

<p>Then he locked up the document in a drawer
of his desk, blew out the lamp, and took a seat
on the sofa next to his wife, perusing attentively
a newspaper.</p>

<p>Frau Kahle departed the following morning
by an early train. Nobody, not even the orderly,
knew her destination. He had taken her trunk
to the station, but she had not told him a word
as to her future intentions. And neither by
letter nor by word of mouth had she left a word
of thanks or apology for her late hosts.</p>

<p>At noon of the same day Lieutenant Kolberg,
whose mind not even the faintest suspicion of
these latest developments of his intrigue had
crossed, was ordered to appear forthwith before
the commander. The latter, dryly and without
comment, informed him that proceedings had
been begun against him before the Council of
Honor, and that until further notice he would
be excused from service.</p>

<p>There was much excitement within the body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of officers. In their secret hearts every one of
them was glad that in the deadening monotony
of their garrison life this affair, painful as it
was, was now assuming tangible proportions.
For not a single one of them had any kindly
feeling for Kolberg, whose secretive disposition
and whose absence from nearly all joint festivities
at the Casino had rendered him unpopular,
and Frau Kahle herself was scarcely better
liked, desperate flirt as she was.</p>

<p>It was because of this that none of the officers,
least of all Borgert, refrained from criticising
in a most uncompromising spirit both Kolberg
and his paramour. And Weil&#8217;s proceedings
were unanimously adjudged perfectly correct.
The remarks made in regard to this whole matter
were by no means couched in such terms as
might have been expected from his Majesty&#8217;s
officers of the army when applied to comrades.
In fact, hard names were used, and everybody
proclaimed aloud his intention severely to cut
&#8220;the vulgar beast&#8221; and &#8220;that coarse woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel von Kronau had had a great fright
when Captain Stark, as president of the Council
of Honor, had handed him in the morning that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
document which had given Weil so much anxious
thought. He ruminated and lugubriously
pondered what had best be done in this unfortunate
affair in order to end it with the least
amount of scandal; but his cogitations were in
vain. The matter had been brought formally
to the attention of the Council of Honor, and,
according to the strict wording of the instructions
provided, there was no squelching or modification
of the proceedings possible. He had to
be satisfied, therefore, to curse most heartily the
author of the fatal document,&mdash;First Lieutenant
Weil,&mdash;and to give him in his thoughts a
big black mark in the next conduct list.</p>

<p>A most unwelcome business, indeed. Already
he saw himself superintending the unloading of
hay-carts on that estate of his, far off in the
eastern, semi-civilized districts of the realm.</p>

<p>But it was poor Major Kahle who would
suffer most of all. After attaining at last the
goal of his desires, all his aspirations were to be
nipped in the bud by the misdemeanor of his
wife. He had no idea where she was now;
she had preferred not to venture near him in
leaving the garrison, since she did not feel sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of a cordial reception on his part. Hence she
had sent her little son to her parents, while she
herself had taken up quarters in Berlin. Her
chief amusement just now consisted in the inditing
of innumerable letters to Kolberg, full
of reproaches for &#8220;having succeeded by his
diabolical arts in alienating her affections from
her husband,&#8221; while the leisure she could spare
from these epistolary efforts was devoted to
roaming that broad international thoroughfare,
Unter den Linden, which presented to her, after
her long &#8220;exile&#8221; close to the frontier, a striking
and highly appreciated contrast.</p>

<p>Kahle was firmly resolved to show the door
to his faithless wife if she should dare present
herself before him; meanwhile he took preliminary
steps to obtain a legal separation from
her.</p>

<p>But there was another thought heavy on his
mind. It was the unavoidable duel. Because
his wife had deceived him, the army code forced
him to next expose himself to the bullet of her
seducer, instead of simply expelling the latter
from the army and giving him a much-needed
period of reflection in jail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>He was expected to &#8220;save the honor of his
wife&#8221; by mortal combat.</p>

<p>What an absurdity! he thought to himself.
Is there any honor left in a wife who deceives
her husband? A coquette she was, heartless and
honorless, nothing more, and yet he must risk
his life in defence of a thing which did not exist
any longer, and which, he now strongly suspected,
had from the first been nothing but a
delusion on his part&mdash;her honor! What a
ludicrous farce!</p>

<p>And he began to reflect whether there was
not some way in which he could escape this
impending duel. Not because he was a coward
or afraid of death; no, he was brave enough,
but he could not see why he should expose to
blind chance not only the fruits of his own arduous
life, but also the future of his son, merely
because another man had acted in a despicable
manner. It was quite possible that his adversary
might kill him in this duel. In that case
he, the innocent party, would suffer the supreme
penalty which man can suffer,&mdash;death,&mdash;and
the criminal himself would go off scot-free.</p>

<p>But reflection showed him clearly that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was no way to avoid mortal combat, for, if he
refused or neglected to send a challenge to the
other, the Council of Honor was bound under
the code to dismiss him from the army, because,
forsooth, he did not know how to &#8220;protect the
honor of the profession.&#8221; On the other hand,
if he did this prescribed duty of &#8220;honor,&#8221; and
fought this duel and escaped being wounded or
killed, a term of confinement in a fortress
awaited him. The latter seemed to him the
lesser of two evils, but he now made up his mind
to show no consideration to the man who had
destroyed the peace of his home, and who was
likely to destroy his existence. He would demand
the most severe conditions for this duel,
and he would not scruple to send a bullet crashing
into his antagonist&#8217;s brain if his arm were
steady enough, or else let the scoundrel deprive
him of his life as well,&mdash;a life which would
hereafter be a burden to him.</p>

<p>The proceedings and investigations of the
Council of Honor required several months.
Things were unearthed which to the younger
officers of the garrison seemed very interesting,
but which threw a dubious light upon Lieutenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Kolberg and his conceptions of honor and
comradeship.</p>

<p>The behavior, too, of the corps of officers
underwent a change during this time.</p>

<p>At first all the officers had shunned Kolberg,
and he was only occasionally seen in the environs
of the garrison when exercising his horses.</p>

<p>But one day Borgert was in severe financial
straits, and then, all his other sources failing,
he had repaired to Kolberg for the money as
a last resort. And Kolberg on his part had been
shrewd enough to use the opportunity to place
Borgert under obligations, for he knew the latter&#8217;s
influence on his younger comrades. Therefore,
Kolberg managed to raise the thousand
marks needed, and put himself at Borgert&#8217;s disposal
for future occasions of the kind.</p>

<p>The result of this man&#339;uvre could have been
foreseen. Within a few days Borgert had
changed his tune in regard to Kolberg&#8217;s character
and failings. At the Casino table he now
sang his praises, lauded the fine qualities of comradeship
possessed by Kolberg, and condemned
the view taken by the superior officers of the
lieutenant&#8217;s guilt, doing all this in his effective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
manner, half banter, half bonhomie; so that
the disgraced one, although not doing actual
duty, became suddenly a well-received guest at
the social functions in the Casino; and not alone
that, he also assumed successfully the part of
host himself, in the much-talked-of little garden-house
under the chestnut trees.</p>

<p>Kolberg could even go so far as to brag at
his own table, while champagne from his cellars
was flowing and his guests smoked his fragrant
Havanas, of the prowess to be shown by him at
the prospective duel. He applied names like
&#8220;<i>D&auml;melsack</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to Kahle, of whom he vowed to
&#8220;make short work.&#8221; In that way he not only
silenced all his former detractors, but actually
became the lion of the garrison&mdash;a dashing
fellow, who had made the conquest of a lady&#8217;s
heart, while others had to be satisfied with lesser
game.</p>

<p>He began to sing small, however, when he
one day received Kahle&#8217;s challenge:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen paces distance, visored duelling
pistols, and an exchange of bullets to the
point of incapacitating one or both parties.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>That he had not expected. Why, this was
murder, he said, and the issue of the forthcoming
duel now became suddenly rather
doubtful to him; all the more as the major
was known to be a good shot, and his reputation
as an excellent Nimrod was known
beyond the confines of the garrison.</p>

<p>So, then, Kolberg earnestly began to train
for the meeting. Day after day he could be
seen issuing forth for a walk into the woods
nearby, for pistol practice. Scores of trees
soon bore the traces of his bullets. When the
day of battle would come he meant to be prepared
to face his adversary well equipped.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when he sent leaden pellets, one
after the other, into his targets, the thought
would occur to him that really he ought not
to hit the major, since he had sinned against
him and betrayed his trust. It was something
like the last flickerings of a feeling of duty
which had dwindled for years in the slow
process of moral decadence: the last flutterings
of a guilt-laden conscience and of a sense
of justice. These dim emotions, however,
were drowned by a more powerful sentiment:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
his newly awakened love of life, the primal
feeling of self-preservation, which seized him
all the harder the more he began to muse
about the possibility of having to lose a life
which offered so much that was worth living
for. An inner voice called to him: &#8220;Thou
shalt not die! Life is sweet!&#8221;</p>

<p>And there was only one way of carrying
out his purpose,&mdash;to kill his man.</p>

<p>In this way, with delays and supplementary
investigation, four months elapsed. Then at
last the Council of Honor pronounced its sentence.
Kolberg was dismissed from the service;
but, along with the formal request to
his Majesty to confirm the sentence, went a
unanimously signed petition for his reinstatement.</p>

<p>The proposed duel was likewise sanctioned,
but not under the conditions proposed by
Kahle. Perhaps it was feared that a fatal
ending to the duel, such as the very stringent
conditions seemed to make almost unavoidable,
would raise too much dust. For quite
recently there had been several cases of a
similar nature, and the death of one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
duellists had had the most disagreeable consequences
for those high-commanding officers
who had neither attempted to modify the conditions
of combat nor endeavored to bring
about reconciliation.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the new terms of the
challenge were: thirty-five paces distance and
one exchange of bullets; ordinary pistols.</p>

<p>Kahle, then, was to be given no opportunity
to punish as he deserved the disturber of his
domestic peace, because superior officers did
not wish to bring unpleasant consequences
upon themselves; for the duel, as now arranged
for under these altered terms, he
regarded as a mere farce, and a possible
fatal issue could be nothing but the work of
blind accident.</p>

<p>Borgert had been requested by Kolberg to
serve as his second, and the former readily
agreed to this; for on the one hand he liked
to play the r&ocirc;le of an onlooker in such an
affair, and on the other he deemed it prudent
to put Kolberg under a new obligation; all
the more as the repaying of his loans seemed
as far off as ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>On the eve of his leaving for that city in
South Germany where the meeting was to
take place, Kolberg once more assembled his
faithful admirers in his quiet little garden-house.
His invitations had been for a banquet,
washed down with some of his choicest
wines. The drinking on that occasion was so
hard that Kolberg himself became completely
intoxicated, and when his guests left he was
snoring in a drunken stupor on his lounge.
The train left early, and Kolberg&#8217;s man had
a hard task in rousing his master sufficiently
at the proper time to hastily prepare him for
his long journey.</p>

<p>Borgert had been in a similar plight. As
he stood on the station platform a few minutes
before the train rolled in, he felt as if he had
only just now risen from his chair at the festive
board.</p>

<p>As he confided this impression to his principal,
Kolberg, he did not forget to mention
incidentally that, &#8220;of course,&#8221; he had forgotten
to take his purse along. With a show
of assumed indifference he stuffed the two
&#8220;blue rags&#8221; into his watchpocket, Kolberg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
having fished the bills with trembling fingers
out of his own wallet, and a silent pressure
of the hand was the only thing Kolberg was
ever to receive in lieu thereof.</p>

<p>They arrived at Kahle&#8217;s garrison in due
time, still in a somewhat dazed condition.
Kahle&#8217;s second had attended to all the preliminaries
of the duel. It was a cold morning
when two cabs rolled out of the town on
their way to the garrison shooting stands,
where the bloody meeting was to take place.</p>

<p>The sun was just peeping over the backs
of the mountains to the east, and sent his
first oblique rays down upon the hoar-frosted
stubble fields.</p>

<p>Peacefully Nature spread her autumnal robe,
and in the forest deep silence reigned. The
only sound, now and then, was the fluttering
of a dead leaf seeking its bed of repose on
the bare earth.</p>

<p>In the first cab sat Kolberg, Borgert, and
two surgeons, while the second was occupied
by Kahle, his second, and the two members of
the Council of Honor, who were to witness
the duel as impartial judges. Beneath the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
rear seat lay the case of pistols. From the
highroad the vehicles turned into a side path,
so narrow that the branches of the trees standing
to right and left frequently beat against
the cab panes.</p>

<p>They reached their destination,&mdash;an opening
in the woods. It was here, secluded from
all curious and observant eyes, that the officers
of the nearby garrison went to settle their
&#8220;affairs of honor.&#8221; The occupants of both
vehicles descended and ordered the drivers to
ride back to the edge of the woods, and there
await their return.</p>

<p>The case containing the pistols was placed
on a slight eminence, and the seconds took
out the weapons; then these were loaded, and
both pistols underwent an examination by the
seconds.</p>

<p>The surgeons took off their coats, spread
out their instruments, and made ready strips
of bandage. Meanwhile the judges had measured
the proper distance and had firmly planted
their swords at either end, to mark the terminal
points. This was accomplished with some
difficulty, as the ground was frozen hard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The customary formal attempt to effect a
reconciliation was ineffectual, of course, and
so the two principals took their stands at the
indicated points.</p>

<p>Kahle looked pale; he trembled with the
cold, and his nervously-twitching features betrayed
intense agitation.</p>

<p>Kolberg, on the contrary, was almost smiling,
and threw away with a careless gesture
the stub of the cigarette he had been smoking
until the last.</p>

<p>One of the judges explained briefly the
order of combat, saying that the shots must
be fired between the words &#8220;one&#8221; and
&#8220;three.&#8221; A moment later he commanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men held their pistols pointed towards
the ground, in order to raise them immediately
on the word &#8220;one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simultaneously with &#8220;two&#8221; Kahle fired,
and the ball struck with a slight noise the
bark of a beech tree, a step or two to the
left of and above his adversary, while a small
twig fell rattling from overhead. Kahle&#8217;s unsteady
hand had given his pistol a slight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
upward turn, so that he had missed his
prey.</p>

<p>Kolberg, however, stood throughout firm
and motionless, and took steady aim, so that
with &#8220;three&#8221; the trigger of his pistol fell.</p>

<p>Kahle looked unflinchingly at the small
black mouth of the pistol pointing at him,
but at the shot he opened his eyes wide,
lurched heavily, and fell headlong.</p>

<p>A cold tremor ran down Kolberg&#8217;s spine as
he saw the tall, powerful man pitch forward,
and for a moment he remained, his smoking
pistol lifted, rooted to the spot. Then the
weapon slipped from his hand.</p>

<p>The others, however, immediately ran
towards the major, and the surgeons tore
open his coat.</p>

<p>There was a small hole in his chest, and
the blood began to ooze from it.</p>

<p>Kahle had lost consciousness for a second
only. Now he lay there, pale, and gazing
steadily at the men busily engaged about him.</p>

<p>Kolberg also approached, holding out his
hand in token of amity; but he quickly withdrew
his hand and retreated out of sight, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
a cold, repellent look from Kahle&#8217;s eyes had
met his. From some short distance in the
rear, out of the reach of those severe eyes,
he attentively viewed his prostrate foe; then
he turned on his heels and made off through
the woods, towards the cabs.</p>

<p>The major&#8217;s wound, however, was found to
be not fatal, although the bullet had grazed the
lungs, and a long time would have to elapse
before he would be up and about once more.</p>

<p>One of the cabs was driven up and the
major carefully lifted into it. The two surgeons
accompanied him inside, while his
second occupied the place next the driver.
Thereupon they drove back at a slow gait to
the city, where the injured man was to be at
once taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>After he had taken farewell from the two
judges as the vehicle reached the outskirts of
the town, Borgert, who remained with Kolberg,
slapped the latter encouragingly on the shoulder
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make such a wry face, man alive!
Be satisfied that you got off with a whole
skin. Of course, it was rough on the poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
devil that you happened to hit him in the
chest; but that&#8217;s something you are not responsible
for; after all, the challenge came
from him. And now let&#8217;s have a good breakfast,
for my stomach rebels against this raw
air. I am not accustomed to knock about the
woods so early in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sincerely sorry that I hit the major
so unluckily,&#8221; replied Kolberg; &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t
mean to, and the devil take the women! It&#8217;s
always their doing. I don&#8217;t know anyway
what made me take up with that silly Kahle
woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother your head about that, my
dear fellow,&#8221; said Borgert. &#8220;The major
alone is to blame, for he ought to have
looked out better for that handsome wife of
his. And as for her, she is not worth a
thought, as we all know. One must treat a
woman as she deserves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert&#8217;s specious eloquence succeeded in a
short while in dispelling the clouds from Kolberg&#8217;s
face, for to his callous perceptions all
that the other had said was true. That there
were heartless and vulgar sentiments contained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in Borgert&#8217;s words he neither understood nor
cared about.</p>

<p>So these worthy twain proceeded to their
hotel, donned citizens&#8217; clothes, and then repaired
to a fashionable restaurant. The
waiters received them with sleepy eyes, being
just engaged in putting the place to rights;
for it was still very early in the day, and they
looked at their guests with something of
amazement.</p>

<p>The two officers started in on their round
of dissipation with several glassfuls of neat
brandy, and wound up, late at night, in a
resort of doubtful repute. Whoever might
have observed them throughout the day, joking
and jesting, could not have helped the
conclusion that these two had clearly forgotten
the events of the morning, and that they
had recovered, together with their peace of
mind, that superficial good humor which so
often distinguishes the conscienceless rascal
from the man of finer mould.</p>

<p>Next day, at noon, our two heroes arrived
at their garrison. They were received with
open arms by a number of their comrades, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the rumor of what had occurred had preceded
them.</p>

<p>A group of officers, in fact, stood on the platform
of the little station as they left their train,
and after much handshaking and congratulations,
all of them accompanied Kolberg to his
dwelling, there to celebrate his triumph in a
&#8220;drop&#8221; of choice wine.</p>

<p>But there were some of the officers, especially
the elder ones, who censured Kolberg for his
heartless behavior. Several of them even went
so far as to say that it would have been more
fitting for him to have remained alone just at
this time, and to make amends for his past follies
by a term of undisturbed self-inspection;
this new orgy they thought, above all, indecent
and coarse.</p>

<p>Two days afterward the confirmation of the
sentence pronounced in his case by the Council
of Honor arrived from Berlin. With it came
likewise the permission for Kolberg to enter the
army anew as a junior lieutenant. That, however,
meant his transference to another garrison,
for in this one there was no room for him.
Before he could start his career afresh in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
beautiful city by the Rhine, Kolberg had to
comply with one other little formality, and that
took him to a fortress where he had to undergo
confinement of an easy description, and lasting
only for a couple of months, because he had
been guilty of &#8220;participation in a duel with
deadly weapons,&#8221; as his Majesty&#8217;s decree read.</p>

<p>The major recovered very slowly. The difficult
operation undertaken by two regimental surgeons
of removing the bullet imbedded near the
spinal column had not entirely succeeded. The
bullet had indeed been removed, but inflammation
of the affected parts had set in, and this
had been accompanied with great pain and a
high fever.</p>

<p>It was only towards the close of winter that
the major was dismissed from the hospital as
a convalescent. His health and his energy
were both gone, and he was compelled to resign
his commission in the army, his strength
being insufficient to discharge the duties of
his post.</p>

<p>He also had been sentenced to a three months&#8217;
term in a fortress in consonance with the invariable
custom followed in such cases by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Kaiser, which makes no distinction between
offender and offended, between victim and aggressor.
But in this instance a confinement of
a few days was considered ample, and at the
expiration of this brief term the imperial pardon
reached the broken-down man, and he was
permitted to depart to wherever his inclination
might take him.</p>

<p>Kahle thus saw his life&#8217;s labor destroyed. As
a man who had scarcely reached forty, yet with
his physical strength nearly spent, he had to
face the question how and where he was to
carve out a new field of activity for himself.
His small pension was wholly insufficient to
enable him to even eke out an existence on it,
and he had, besides, by the decree of the court,
been intrusted with the sole custody of his
child. This, while it gave him at least an object
in life, was for a man in his circumstances
an additional grave burden; for his little son
was still of that tender age to require a woman&#8217;s
constant ministrations.</p>

<p>The small fortune which his divorced wife
had brought into their marriage had, of course,
been handed back to her by the law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>And why had all this misfortune overtaken
him?</p>

<p>Because the army code and social conventions
had bidden him to save as much of the &#8220;honor&#8221;
of his wife as he could. To this mistaken idea
he had been sacrificed.</p>

<p>And Kolberg was domiciled by the vine-clad
borders of the Rhine, and in his new garrison
led a life as dissipated and as free of care as
he had in his former one.</p>

<h3>AN AIRY STRUCTURE COLLAPSES</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>eated</span> at his desk in his elegantly furnished
apartments, we see First Lieutenant
Borgert.</p>

<p>Before him lay a large sheet of paper covered
with rows of figures, and all around him
whole mountains of documents, bills, and vari-colored
envelopes.</p>

<p>One after another he took up these bits of
paper, and from them noted down amounts on
the big sheet. He had already reached the third
column when he suddenly ceased his labors and
threw the pencil disgustedly away. Then he
grasped the whole pile and threw it into the
fire, where in a few moments it was consumed
in the leaping flame and reduced to a tiny mass
of ashes.</p>

<p>His laudable purpose had been to go through
all the claims against him, so far as they had
been presented. Usually his simple method was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to throw bills, as they reached him, into the
stove; but for once he had been curious to find
out how much he really owed in the world, or
at least to gain an approximate idea of his
indebtedness.</p>

<p>But we have seen that he gave it up as an
impossible task. To tread the mazes of these
bundles of dunning letters, plaints, simple bills,
and formal orders issued to him by the colonel
to discharge certain debts submitted to his
authority, was more than Borgert felt himself
equal to, especially as the conviction had very
soon dawned on him that his was labor lost.
This much had become quite clear: to pay his
debts was impossible, for their total rose far
and away above his surmises. When he had
left off in sheer disgust, the neat little sum of
eleven thousand marks had been reached, and
to that had to be added the other mountain
of bills which he had just consigned to the
flames.</p>

<p>Most of all, the seven hundred marks which
he owed to Captain K&ouml;nig lay on his conscience;
but there were some other items that pressed
him hard, for they were &#8220;debts of honor,&#8221; contracted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
with his equals in the social scale; and
the first of these, amounting to two thousand
three hundred marks, was due in about six
weeks. How and where should he raise these
large amounts?</p>

<p>He began to reflect. The furniture had already
been saddled with a chattel mortgage, one
of his horses even been mortgaged twice, and
for the other, his former charger, he probably
would not get more than three hundred marks,
and that was nothing but a drop on a hot stone.
Of his comrades there was none remaining with
whom an attempt to borrow would have had the
slightest prospect of success,&mdash;possibly K&ouml;nig
alone excepted. But should he go to him again
with such a request? It could not be easily
done,&mdash;at least not before the old item of seven
hundred marks had been paid back. The only
safety anchor he could think of was a formal
request for a large loan from a Berlin usurer
with a large client&egrave;le in the army. In fact, he
had tried it; but the fellow had not yet been
heard from, although three weeks had gone
since this same individual had been furnished
with a surety given by First Lieutenant Leimann,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and with a life insurance policy in the
amount of twenty thousand marks.</p>

<p>For the moment nothing could be done. He
would try to pacify in some way the most pressing
of his creditors, and to pay in small instalments
only those who either should begin legal
proceedings against him, or lodge their complaints
with the regiment. Perhaps&mdash;who
could tell?&mdash;an undiscovered source might
open somewhere; perhaps luck at the cards,
so long unfaithful to him, would return, or one
of his many tickets in various state lotteries
would draw a big prize. And who could tell
but what the biggest prize of all, a wealthy
bride with a good fat dowry, might not fall to
his share? He had formal applications of the
kind on file with several of the most prominent
and successful marriage agencies at the capital
and elsewhere, and only recently one of these
centres for the radiation of connubial bliss, so
much in vogue with his kind throughout the
empire, had been heard from to some apparent
purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a bundle of bright hopes,&#8221; he said to
himself, and with that his plastic mind resumed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
its equilibrium. His good humor returned, he
lit himself a cigarette, and whistled a gay tune,
while pacing the thick Smyrna rugs in the centre
of his study.</p>

<p>His alert ear heard a whispering in the corridor.
He discerned the soft tread of nimble
feet on the hall carpet, and then there was a
knock at his door.</p>

<p>That must be Frau Leimann, he thought to
himself, for she frequently paid him hasty visits
at the afternoon tea hour, because at that time
her husband used to go to the &#8220;<i>D&auml;mmerschoppen</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his &#8220;Come,&#8221; however, a poorly clad
woman with a basket on her arm stepped over
the threshold. Her youthful face showed already
the unmistakable stamp which care and
sorrow had imprinted on it, and she gazed shyly
at the officer who had remained standing in the
centre of the room, whence he eyed his visitor
with undisguised displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is it you want again, Frau
Meyer?&#8221; he blurted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you once before
that I will give you no more washing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg the Herr First Lieutenant will excuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
me, but I wanted to ask whether I cannot
have to-day those forty marks, or at least a part
of them. I badly need money, for my husband
has been lying sick for three weeks past and is
unable to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&#8221; replied Borgert, roughly.
&#8220;Come back to-morrow night; I have no small
change about me, and I haven&#8217;t any time to
spare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I hope you will keep faith with me this
time, Herr First Lieutenant; you have promised
so often to pay me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that she diffidently opened the door and
left, but Borgert undid one of the windows and
let the pure autumn air stream in. The odor
of these poverty-stricken wretches was insupportable
to him. Disgusting! He took from a
carved cabinet on the wall a large perfume
bottle, and sprinkled a good portion of its contents
upon the costly rugs and the upholstery
of his furniture. Then he rang the bell for his
servant.</p>

<p>The man stepped in briskly. It was Private
R&ouml;se, whom the captain no longer wanted in
the front, since he had proven unreliable, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
with his deficient conceptions of military discipline
would only be an injury to the squadron.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I order you to do, you swine?&#8221;
the officer shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was to let nobody in without being announced,&#8221;
answered R&ouml;se with diffidence; &#8220;but
the woman passed me by, and I could not hinder
her from going in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then throw the carrion out, thou sloppy
beast! The first time somebody is let in again
without my consent, I&#8217;ll cowhide you within an
inch of your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>In saying which, he struck R&ouml;se with both
fists in the face, then thrust open the door and
kicked him out.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the hag should come back to-morrow
night, you tell her I&#8217;ve just gone out!&#8221; he
called after him.</p>

<p>Borgert had just seated himself, with a newspaper,
by the window when the floor bell once
more sounded. It was a short, energetic tinkle.
The servant came in and announced, with a face
still wet with tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman would like to see the Herr First
Lieutenant!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his name? I told you always to
get the name first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man left the room, but immediately
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not give me his name, but he says
he must speak with the Herr First Lieutenant
in any event.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then ask him in!&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later a man stepped in, carrying
a large wallet under his arm, and introduced
himself,&mdash;&#8220;Bailiff Krause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begging the Herr First Lieutenant&#8217;s
pardon in case I should disturb him, but I
have a mandate from the court. Please, here
it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he took from his wallet a voluminous
envelope and handed it to Borgert, who, however,
did not lose his presence of mind, and
answered in a pleasant tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I know. Has already been settled yesterday;
for I presume it is for that small
amount which I owe to my tailor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I know, Herr First Lieutenant,
it is about the matter of the firm of Froehlich
&amp; Co., the sum demanded, on bills of exchange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
signed by you, being four thousand marks, for
furniture sold and delivered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it! The firm might have
spared itself that trouble; the whole amount
was transmitted by my bank day before yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better, then,&#8221; jested the official.
&#8220;I have the honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, Herr Krause; I would say <i>au
revoir</i>, but your visit always means a doubtful
pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the man was gone, Borgert tore open
the envelope and scanned the contents of the
document it contained.</p>

<p>That was a most disagreeable business. The
furniture had not yet been paid for, but already
mortgaged, although the explicit terms of the
contract forbade his doing so until after payment
in full to the merchant had made the whole
his own property.</p>

<p>Four thousand marks! A heap of money!
He would have to speak to Leimann; perhaps
he could do something.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he remembered that the bailiff
had not passed out into the street through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
front garden. He called his servant and asked
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did the man go to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upstairs, Herr First Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Leimann&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so, Herr First Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, now, what had he to do up there?
Could it be possible that they also were in his
toils? That indeed would be bad, for Leimann
had, in spite of all, remained something like an
aid and help to him in becoming surety for
payments promised or in calming obstreperous
creditors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Herr Krause handed to Frau Leimann,
scared almost out of her wits, the summons
in an action begun by the firm of Weinstein
&amp; Co., to which she owed a matter of four hundred
marks for a silk robe furnished by them.</p>

<p>She was in despair, and scurried to and fro
in the room, vainly cudgelling her brain for an
idea that would bring her succor. What could
she do? Where should she get the money?
She would go to Borgert and ask him for the
amount. But what would he think of her?
Would he not lose all respect for her?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment she stood undecided in her
room, and pressed both hands against her
wildly beating heart. Then she went resolutely
to the door and hastened down the back
stairs.</p>

<p>She found Borgert musing in an easy-chair,
and he did not even rise when she entered, but
merely waved his hand in greeting to her. But
she stepped up to him and kissed him tenderly
on the forehead, and then she sat down close by
him. He was puzzled by her demeanor, and
looked up questioningly into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of visitors do you receive nowadays?&#8221;
he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Visitors?&#8221; Frau Leimann retorted with
some embarrassment. &#8220;I have received nobody,&mdash;truly
not, nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>And while she said it her eyes wandered about
the room without meeting his.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have received no visitor? Oh, but
that is a big fib!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you say so, George; who
should have been to see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I merely thought a certain Herr
Krause called on you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; she cried, startled
by his knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know everything, my child; even that the
bailiff was just in to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Leimann was covered with confusion,
and mechanically began to fondle the seam of
her little silk apron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you know, it is unnecessary for me
to tell you. Yes, he was to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he want?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pretty woman told him the details. With
a tear-choked voice she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am lost if my husband hears of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see. If he has bought it he
must, of course, pay for the dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows of nothing. I had to have the
dress, the red silk, you know. I told him at that
time that my mother had sent it; for he would
have refused me, and I had to have it, and so I
took it on my own account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very stupid of you. Where will
you take the money from now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know. Cannot you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go to those people and ask them for
time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There would be no use in doing that,
George; I must have the cash. I need at least
a thousand marks, for I have to pay for other
things as well&mdash;the dressmaker, the hair-dresser,
the shoemaker, etc. Get me the money,
George, and show me that you really love me as
much as you always say you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; Borgert set up an unpleasant laugh.
&#8220;Good heavens, I don&#8217;t know myself what is
to become of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so? Are you in debt too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would take the trouble to devote some
attention to that big sheet of paper over there
on my desk, you might be able to tell. That
sort of thing I get every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Leimann stepped up to the desk, unfolded
the big sheet, and stared with wide-open
eyes at the formidable columns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I had no idea of this, George! What
is to become of all this? You were my only
reliance, and now I am entirely undone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank, sobbing, down on the divan and
covered her face with both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose courage at once, you little goose;
you won&#8217;t die for the lack of these few hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
marks!&#8221; Borgert consoled her, affectionately
passing his hand over her blonde hair. &#8220;I will
see what can be done, and in a week&#8217;s time
you&#8217;ll have your thousand marks.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an answer she put her arms passionately
around Borgert&#8217;s neck, and thanked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that you would not leave me in the
lurch, thou best one!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>When Leimann returned home about eight
o&#8217;clock, he found all the rooms dark and silent.</p>

<p>To his question about his wife the maid
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;The gracious lady has gone out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, Herr First Lieutenant!&#8221;</p>

<p>He lit a lamp and then went to the letter-box
to ascertain whether anything had arrived by
the evening mail. He found two letters with
bills inside, amounting to over six hundred
marks.</p>

<p>He did a little grumbling to himself, and then
locked up the two &#8220;rags&#8221; in his desk.</p>

<p>In doing so he noticed a large yellow envelope.
Supposing it to be an official letter, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
seized it, intending to open it. But he found
that it had been already opened, and his curiosity
grew as he drew from it three large sheets.</p>

<p>Without at first catching its purport, he gazed
at the clerical handwriting in it, and then he
sat down at the table and read the whole document
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Ah, indeed, his wife too? Why, that was
quite a charming surprise! If her funds were
running so low as to oblige her to contract debts
it would be vain, he thought, to expect any help
from his mother-in-law, and yet he had always
counted on her as a last resort. In a rage he
flung the summons and the legal statement into
a corner and went up and down in the room,
musing on the financial embarrassment of his
wife.</p>

<p>Probably Frau Leimann had heard the steady
tramp of his feet through the ceiling, for now
she entered with exuberant excuses.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear George,&#8221; said she, breathlessly, &#8220;I
had a pressing engagement with my dressmaker,
and I ran after you in the street. I saw you
passing before me, but I could not catch up with
you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you have to do with your dressmaker?&#8221;
Leimann confronted her furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else should I have had to do there
than business for which I pay her? She is
making a riding-habit for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better first pay for your old rubbish
before ordering any new gear!&#8221; shouted he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why this tone to me? And who tells you
that I do not pay my bills? You think, I suppose,
that I&#8217;m squandering my money as you
are squandering yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not wish me to see what the
bailiff brings you, you had better not leave it
directly under my nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>His wife for an instant did not quite understand
what he meant by that, but then she recollected
that she had left the summons on her
husband&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you very emphatically,&#8221; she flared
up indignantly, &#8220;not to put your nose into my
private correspondence. If the letter was lying
open on the table, you had no right to read it.
<i>I</i> never look at <i>your</i> bills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do what you please; but I must request
you not to bring the bailiff to my house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not the worst, <i>mon cher</i>, that may
happen to you; he will know now at least the
way here when he&#8217;ll call on you next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue, you impudent woman, or
I will throw you into the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many thanks for your kind offer, but I&#8217;m
going of my own accord.&#8221;</p>

<p>She left the room, went into her bed-chamber,
and retired to rest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the floor below Borgert was
reading a book; but his thoughts were far away.
He had serious forebodings that all his creditors,
like a pack of hungry wolfhounds, were
about to engage in a joint hunt for him, or
rather for the money that he didn&#8217;t have. He
was afraid that the colonel would soon demand
the immediate payment of his load of debts, and
that, if unable to comply with the order, resignation
from the army was the only possible
outcome. And what should he do then, without
a penny, without any useful knowledge, and
with many luxurious habits? Something must
be done, he made up his mind, and he was going
to employ the next day, a Sunday, to consider
once more the various possibilities of raising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a large sum, no matter how, to discharge all
these liabilities, most of them small in themselves,
but in their totality representing quite
a fortune.</p>

<p>Solaced by the hope that after all some mild
hand would open and drop into his lap a small
mountain of gold, he fell asleep; the book
slipped from his hands, and the lamp on the
night table went out after midnight, since Borgert
had forgotten to blow it out. He slept restlessly,
and bad dreams pursued him. His load
of debt developed into a nightmare that was
pressing on his chest and threatening to crush
out his life.</p>

<p>When he awoke in the morning it was past
ten. Borgert began to rage. Almost half the
day was gone now, and yet he had meant to
do so much. Had this ass of a servant again
forgotten to wake him? With that his head
ached, and he felt nervous and out of sorts.
Throwing his dressing-gown loosely about him
he went into his servant&#8217;s room and found R&ouml;se
laboriously penning a letter. When his master
entered the poor fellow shot out of the seat and
stood bolt upright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you wake me, you beast?&#8221; he
thundered at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wakened the Herr First Lieutenant at
seven o&#8217;clock, but the Herr First Lieutenant
wanted to continue sleeping and said I need not
come back any more to annoy him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie, you swine; I will teach you to
do as you are told.&#8221; And he seized a leather
belt lying on the fellow&#8217;s bed, and with it struck
R&ouml;se violently, then kicking him, and letting
the belt play around his face and neck until
broad livid marks began to show.</p>

<p>R&ouml;se preserved his military attitude, and
stood his punishment without in the least resisting.
But that was a further cause of anger to
Borgert, and the latter dropped the belt, and
with his fist struck the man several hard blows
in the chest. Then he took the man&#8217;s letter, half
finished as it was, crumpled it up in his hand,
and threw it into the coal-scuttle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step upstairs lively and tell Herr First
Lieutenant Leimann that I want to speak to him.
Tell him if possible to step in here for half an
hour before he goes to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At your orders, Herr First Lieutenant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert stepped back to his chamber, finished
dressing, and then went into the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there stood his coffee, but cold
as ice. In that case R&ouml;se must have been before
him in the room. Well, a drubbing or two
would do the fellow no harm. That was good
for preserving discipline and a respect for his
superiors, even if now and then it should be
applied not exactly at the right moment.</p>

<p>On his desk were lying several letters. Three
of them contained bills, and the fourth was from
his father. The three he threw unopened into
the fire, and the fourth he read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>,&mdash;With growing concern I have seen
from your last letter that you had again to incur large
expenditures which harass you because you had not
counted on them. Much as my desire would be to let
you have the money you ask, with the best intentions
it is not possible to do so. You know best how closely
I have to economize to make both ends meet. If
seventy-five marks would be any object to you, I could
let you have them, although I had promised your
mother this money for a new dress of which she stands
in much need.</p>

<p>But I must frankly confess to you that I do not see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
why you should not be able to meet all your legitimate
expenses with your pay and the two hundred marks
allowance per month. At your age I did not have
more than that myself, and yet I was able to undertake
an extended trip every year. I give you the well-meant
advice to live for a time a little more apart
from your comrades, in order to reduce your expenses.
Employ yourself diligently at home&mdash;there is so much
to learn in your profession nowadays&mdash;and avoid carefully
every opportunity which would force you into
needless outlay which you would subsequently not be
able to meet. Make your scale of living correspond to
your income. If you will openly declare that this or
that is too costly for you, every one will respect you the
more, for they will see that you are not spending beyond
your proper income. Do not live carelessly, and shun
those amusements which you cannot afford. After all,
it is both sensible and high-minded to live within one&#8217;s
means.</p>

<p>Write to me soon how you have regulated this affair
and whether the small sum I can offer you will be of
advantage to you.</p>

<p>In the hope that no inconvenience of a serious
character will grow out of your present embarrassment,</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="padding-right: 25%">I remain,</span><br />
<span style="padding-right: 10%">Your affectionate</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Old Father</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>When Borgert had read these lines, he
crushed the paper within his palm and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
cast it likewise into the stove. With a sigh he
sank into a chair and began to ruminate.</p>

<p>At this moment his servant entered and announced
Leimann.</p>

<p>Borgert went to the door to meet his friend,
and when they had stepped into his study, Leimann
asked with considerable anxiety:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what important matter is it you have
for me this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert planted himself squarely on his legs in
front of the other and said with assumed gaiety:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, my dear fellow, we all have our
troubles. I have just about reached the end of
my tether and should like to appoint you receiver
of my assets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The end of your tether?&#8221; retorted Leimann
with agitation. &#8220;What do you mean by that?
Do you mean in money matters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have guessed it. I must have money
right now, a whole bagful of it, or else I&#8217;m
done for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it as bad as all that? Have new complications
arisen? Why, you told me the last
time that you were out of your troubles just
now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did; but yesterday I made something
of an investigation, and I found that there
is no other way out my difficulties than by
means of a gigantic loan. I should like, therefore,
to speak openly to you about the matter,
for I&#8217;m in hopes that there must be still ways
and means to keep me above water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leimann lowered his eyes, looked fixedly at
the pattern of the Turkish rug, and rubbed reflectively
his unshaven chin. Then he replied
with a shrug:</p>

<p>&#8220;How much is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve thousand marks I must have, and not
a penny less, for I&#8217;ll have to make a clear track.
I&#8217;m about badgered to death by these unceasing
dunning letters and complaints in the courts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm, and how did you think you were going
to manage this matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have some more addresses of financial
men, usurers, you know. If I could get you
once more to go security for me, I think we
ought to be able to attain our end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Security? Security? Yes, it is easy for
you to talk that way, my dear boy; but finally
there must be something in the background in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
order to assume responsibility for another&#8217;s
debts. I must tell you frankly that if you
can&#8217;t meet this payment of three thousand
marks of last month, there will be the devil
to pay for me, since I went bail for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think there is any need of your
being so explicit; as a matter of course, I shall
meet my obligations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it in the least; but for me it
is indeed impossible to become security for you
once more. Not only that, but I have to ask
you to let me have some money, for I really do
need some very badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the greatest of pleasure,&#8221; said Borgert
with a sinister smile; &#8220;but why don&#8217;t
you raise money on your &#8216;commiss-fortune&#8217;?<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
That, it strikes me, would be the surest way of
obtaining it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My &#8216;commiss-fortune&#8217;? Very well put;
but I&#8217;d have to have one in order to raise
money on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been marrying on, then?&#8221;
asked Borgert in amazement.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I only had it four weeks in my hands, when
it was returned to the party who had lent it for
a consideration until I had obtained the official
consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert looked in consternation at his friend
and then began to measure the room in nervous
excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; he began, after making several
turns of the room, &#8220;I will make another
proposition: I become surety for you, and you
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; cried Leimann, joyfully; &#8220;but it is
a somewhat ticklish business, for some time or
other there is bound to come a crash, and then
if neither of us has a penny there will be the
deuce and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That catastrophe will not happen, my most
beloved friend, because if I can pull through
once more there will be nothing to fear for me.
I shall marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the eternal gods, but you have amazing
courage! Only let me tell you, be careful in
the choice of your father-in-law, otherwise it
is a worse than useless arrangement. I myself
can speak from experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a matter of course; I shan&#8217;t marry
on empty promises. For less than half a million
they cannot do business with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wish you luck; but, come to think
of it, how is it about K&ouml;nig? Couldn&#8217;t he
be induced to come out with a few thousand
marks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of him, but it seems to me
doubtful whether he can be got at. For, first
of all, we would have to pay him the old
score.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; but we might make at least an
attempt. He can&#8217;t say more than &#8216;no,&#8217; and I
shall sit down at once and write a few lines
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leimann took a chair at the desk and a sheet
of letter-paper from one of the drawers.</p>

<p>Borgert sat down quietly in a corner, lit a
cigarette, and blew its smoke into the slanting
triangle of floating particles of dust
which was formed by a ray of sunlight penetrating
his window. The bluish wreaths of
smoke formed fantastic bands, weaving and
interweaving.</p>

<p>Now at last the letter was ended, and Leimann<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
closed it, wrote the address on the outside,
and R&ouml;se was told to take it immediately
to its destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will pull his leg, I think, if anything
will!&#8221; said Leimann, with a satisfied air, as he
arose from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you written him?&#8221; asked Borgert
with some curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply this,&mdash;that I needed money for a
comrade and appealed therefore to his generous
sentiments of friendship which he had so often
proved. As a term for repayment I have indicated
three months hence, and have pledged my
word for the punctual refunding of the money;
for you told me, you know, that you would
have it here by that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most assuredly I can. If the fellow will
only give us the money now, everything else
will be attended to at its proper time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus they chatted on for another half hour,
when R&ouml;se returned with his answer from Captain
K&ouml;nig.</p>

<p>Leimann quickly grasped the letter, but then
he hesitated before opening it. Undecided, he
scanned the address and looked questioningly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
at Borgert, who was still comfortably seated in
his chair.</p>

<p>At last, however, impatience mastered him,
and Leimann tore open the envelope and unfolded
the letter.</p>

<p>With consternation he read again and again.
Borgert saw from the face of his friend, who
with eyebrows lifted and hands trembling with
nervous excitement stood there a picture of
disappointment, that K&ouml;nig&#8217;s answer had not
brought joyful news. But he was more quiet
and felt less disappointment than Leimann,
although the whole matter concerned in the
first place rather him than the latter. It was
no longer new to him to receive denials to his
letters requesting loans.</p>

<p>His face, though, assumed a wrathful expression
when Leimann handed him silently K&ouml;nig&#8217;s
response, and he began to read it. In his letter
the captain said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I earnestly regret that I&#8217;m not able to comply
with your wishes. On the one hand considerations for
my family restrain me, for sums of such magnitude I
could only advance if perfect security for their repayment
were offered. But the only pledge <i>you</i> offer me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
for punctual return of the money is your word of
honor, and I am sorry to say I cannot look upon that
as such an absolute security, since you as well as First
Lieutenant Borgert have not yet refunded the divers
amounts which I loaned you months ago, although you
at the time passed your word to me to see that the
debt was paid promptly within ten days. Besides, it
seems to me, that your financial condition, as far as I
understand it, is not of a description to guarantee the
keeping of a promise of that kind made to me.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Borgert rose from his chair and flung the
letter aside in a rage. Then he stepped to the
window and looked down into the street.</p>

<p>Neither of the two spoke a word; but as their
glances met, Leimann remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you say to this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A piece of insolence, a vulgar bit of presumption
it is on his part!&#8221; Borgert broke out.
&#8220;How the devil does this fellow dare, anyway,
to concern himself with our private affairs?
It would have been merely an unfriendly act
and would have shown a deficient spirit of comradeship
to send us a reply refusing our request,
but to do so in this offensive manner!
We cannot quietly submit to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are you going to do about it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>&#8221;
retorted Leimann with a shrug. &#8220;If you openly
take a stand against him, he has us by the throat
if he merely states that we did not keep our
pledged word, and we could not dispute that,
for he can show it in black and white. Therefore
it will be best for us to pocket his rudeness
and to cut the fellow; he will not fail to
notice that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently he has entirely forgotten that it
would be an easy matter for us to break his
neck. Did he not say himself at the time that
he was going to take the amount in question
from the squadron fund? I think we could
make it very unpleasant for him if we were to
use this fact against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Leimann, &#8220;but you could not
in decency bring up the matter, since his touching
those funds was done in our interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. If he at present takes the
liberty to throw impudent remarks in our faces,
I will certainly show him that I&#8217;m in a condition
to pay him back in the same coin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you cannot possibly sign a formal accusation
stating that K&ouml;nig had lent you money
obtained from the squadron fund. Do you not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
see that that would throw a curious light upon
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t be so clumsy as to do that.
There are other ways in which the trick could
be done, and I shall manage to let nobody suspect
me as the author of the tale. But he will
have to pay for this, you can take my word for
that. D&mdash;&mdash; the ugly face of him, anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both became silent once more, and a few
minutes later Leimann took his leave, since he
had to attend to several minor engagements in
town before the dinner hour.</p>

<p>Nor did Borgert remain much longer at
home. He went to the Casino and drowned
his bad humor in a bottle of Heidsieck.</p>

<p>When Borgert awoke, a couple of days later,
from a night&#8217;s troubled sleep, he noticed with
concern that he had overslept himself and missed
his earlier duties. He rang the bell for his servant,
but R&ouml;se did not appear, not even on a
second summons.</p>

<p>Borgert dressed and went to R&ouml;se&#8217;s room.
He found it unoccupied. The bed was untouched,
and on top of it lay the uniform and
the cap of the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>With astonishment the officer looked about
him; the sticky, unventilated atmosphere of the
little chamber, and a strong odor of soiled linen
and worn-out clothes, was all that he noticed.
Where could R&ouml;se have gone so early in the
day, and that, too, without leave, even without
a word to him? Had he been summoned to
some unexpected duty? But no, that was impossible,
for here lay his regimentals.</p>

<p>Borgert had already crossed over to the
threshold to leave the room again when his
eye lighted on a much-stained slip of paper on
the table. He picked it up and his face paled
while he read, for in the man&#8217;s scrawling handwriting
there were the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell! And go to the devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>As if petrified, Borgert stared at the paper.
The fellow, then, had deserted!</p>

<p>About his reasons for the step Borgert was
not in doubt a minute, and a sudden feeling of
shame and disquiet seized him at the thought
that the man might be apprehended. In that
case everything would come to light: the bad
usage to which he had been subjected, the maltreatment
which he had met at his hands, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
worst of all, all those big or little secrets of
which he had become aware during his service
with his master.</p>

<p>Too unpleasant! Borgert stepped again over
to his room and sat down on the edge of the
bed. His face was not pleasant to look at, and
a nervous twitching of his features showed how
much he dreaded an unlucky turn of affairs in
case the fugitive should be caught and then blab
out all he knew.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if of late there was a
perfect conspiracy against him. Anxiety, ill
luck, and disappointment on every side, with
not a single silver lining to the cloud, which,
black and ominous, had suddenly begun to
crowd his horizon.</p>

<p>For the first time the awful certainty flashed
through his mind that he stood at the brink of
a catastrophe against which there was no remedy
unless a miracle intervened. But where under
the sun should such a miracle come from? All
faith, all hope, dissolved before his view in these
few moments when the whole crushing weight
of his guilt, the whole labyrinth of his failure
in life, came clearly to his consciousness. An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
unreasoning terror, a fear of himself and a feeling
of helplessness conquered the man, who at
other times had never surrendered to untoward
conditions, who had never hesitated to stamp
down all obstacles in his path. Borgert was not
capable of deep feeling or of noble sentiment;
he had so far trodden the path of life with cold
egotism, coupled with a superficial view of his
surroundings and a lack of clearer insight into
the motives impelling him and others.</p>

<p>For some time he sat there, pallid, motionless,
gazing into the vast blank space of the unknown
future; only the convulsive workings of his face
betrayed the intense agitation of his mind. It
was the psychological crisis in the life of a man
who too late becomes aware of having destroyed
his better self, of having annihilated all those
hopes which on entering life had floated before
his vision in roseate hue. And there was nothing
to which he could cling, not even a straw for
this man battling with the waves that threatened
to engulf him, no human soul that could or
would help him. Despair clutched his throat,
and his breath came thick and short like that
of one drowning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Borgert had struck a balance with himself.
He had taken stock, and now felt clearly that
his life was one not only marred but destroyed
by his own fault. He made up his mind to
bear the consequences since escape there was
none.</p>

<p>Mechanically he completed his toilet and then
went to the barracks to report himself to the
captain for having missed the morning service.
He kept silence about R&ouml;se&#8217;s flight, saying to
himself that if the deserter had the start of
pursuit by a sufficiency of time, say forty-eight
hours, he would be a bigger fool indeed than
Borgert took him to be if he had not reached
a safe retreat across the frontier. And that,
of course, would spare Borgert himself the
unpleasant predicament of facing a court-martial
because of systematic maltreatment of a
subordinate.</p>

<p>When he returned home at noon, Borgert
found a letter. It was the reply of the financial
man in Berlin to whom, in his quandary, he
had turned. The letter told the recipient in
curt terms that his application had been rejected.
No loan could be made to him, it said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
since inquiries about Borgert and his co-called
bondsmen, and the endorsement of Leimann,
had &#8220;demonstrated a financial status highly
unfavorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert received this news almost with indifference,
for since this morning he had abandoned
all hope of a favorable turn, and hence
felt no disappointment.</p>

<p>He knew he could obtain no money anywhere
after this. In fact, now that he clearly envisaged
things, it seemed astonishing that the
bubble had not burst long ere this. It had been
solely due, as he now felt, to Leimann&#8217;s extraordinary
skill in hiding his own pecuniary embarrassments
that Borgert himself had been able
to run up large accounts without any tangible
security whatever. For Leimann, he remembered,
had backed him up throughout.</p>

<p>Dazed and spent, Borgert lay down on his
divan.</p>

<p>He did not wish to go to the Casino, for he
felt no appetite, and he was not in the mood to
play his accustomed pranks and capers for the
delectation of his comrades. He did not want
to see or hear of anybody. He wanted to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
all by himself and indulge in his morose reflections.
His eye wandered around the elegant
appointments of his dwelling. These fine paintings
on his walls; this handsome and costly
furniture, most of it carved in solid oak; the
soft Oriental rugs underfoot which deadened
every sound and made his bachelor home so
comfortable and cosy; those heavy, discreet
hangings of finest velvet which shut out the
intrusive light and kept his apartments in that
epicurean <i>chiaroscuro</i> which his sybarite taste
demanded&mdash;what a pity, what an infernal
shame, to have to surrender into the hands of
these vermin of usurers all these trappings of
his bachelor freedom! Of course, they would
struggle and fight for it all, and each one of
them would scramble to be the first to assert and
enforce his rights. Rather amusing it would be,
he thought, but alas! he himself would not be
able to view the scene.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. Within a few
days the crash must come; he could see no
escape.</p>

<p>But what was to become of himself? He had
never seriously thought of that before. Should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
he allow himself to be simply thrown into the
street? Perhaps, after all, they would even put
him in quod? Time pressed, and a decision
must be reached quickly&mdash;at once.</p>

<p>Really, on sober reflection, he could not very
well see why he should remain any longer in
this vale of tears after all his glory and his
pleasures would be gone. To learn anew, after
losing all caste, after dismissal from the army
in disgrace and dishonor, to learn a bread-winning
calling and to have to work like everybody
in that despised throng of perspiring, vulgar
toilers&mdash;surely, that was not at all to his taste.
From infancy up he had been reared in disdain
of labor&mdash;had acquired, one by one, tastes and
habits of thought that seemed irreconcilable with
a life of sober, plain living and thinking, with
a life where his part would be that of a subordinate.
It seemed an impossible thing to him.
Dimly he felt that to do so would require energy,
self-denial, and diligence, and of all these he
possessed not a trace. Should he then make
an end of it, put a bullet in his brain?</p>

<p>But no, that was absurd, and, besides, that
required courage. And courage, in its best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
sense, he had never had. He had only shown
courage, or the semblance of it&mdash;a certain dash&mdash;the
kind which in the army is known as
&#8220;<i>Schneid</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here, when facing the final realities of
life, his courage entirely deserted him. And
was it not possible, after all, that luck would
come to his aid in this dire extremity? He had
only the one life, and once thrown away the
loss was irremediable. Suicide therefore would
be rash and stupid&mdash;folly never to be redeemed.
Life might smile on him again, and should he
then with his own hand cut it off? No, on no
account.</p>

<p>But no rescuing thought would occur to him,
cudgel his brain as he might. And torturing,
self-abasing reflections crowded again into his
brain.</p>

<p>The thought of his servant, of poor R&ouml;se,
curiously enough, was uppermost. Had not
R&ouml;se, dolt that he was, cunningly managed to
disappear from a scene which was, in a certain
sense, as unbearable as his master&#8217;s at this juncture?
And R&ouml;se by now was perhaps seated
comfortably in a quiet corner where nobody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
was looking for him, and where it was possible
to live without interference.</p>

<p>Could he himself, then, not do the same
thing?</p>

<p>And this shadowy thought began to take solid
form the more Borgert dwelt on it. It seemed
to him the only egress from the situation.</p>

<p>In new surroundings, in another country,
amongst people who did not know him, he
might begin life afresh, and soon grass would
grow over the short-lived sensation which his
disappearance would create in this world-forgotten
little hole of a town! Within a twelvemonth
his very name perhaps would be no
longer on anybody&#8217;s lips in this place. And even
if in times to come this or that one of his comrades
should mention his name, it would be with
the thought that such a man had existed at
some time or other, and that nobody to-day
cared about him any more.</p>

<p>He was so lost in his dreary thoughts that
he did not observe the door opening and giving
admittance to Frau Leimann.</p>

<p>She looked pale and serious. Her face, so
pleasant in its youthful, placid beauty at other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
times, now appeared aged, and her eyes wore
an anxious expression.</p>

<p>Borgert did not rise, but contented himself
with nodding to her, saying never a word. His
glance enveloped this woman, an intrigue with
whom had seemed to him but a short while
ago an ambition worthy of his talents.</p>

<p>But to-day she appeared to him no longer
so desirable; her motions seemed to him without
grace or distinction, and her charms
mediocre.</p>

<p>Her hair was arranged in negligent fashion,
and the soft folds of her morning gown to-day
seemed to enwrap another woman and not the
one whose beauty had intoxicated him.</p>

<p>Two impressions stood out clearly in his
mind: the woman as she now faced him, and
as she had appeared to him on a memorable
evening.</p>

<p>But Frau Leimann was so preoccupied herself
that the unflattering and searching look of
Borgert escaped her. She sat down on the
divan beside him and took his hand in hers.
Her eyes gazed with diffidence at the face of
the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill, George?&#8221; asked she with
anxiety.</p>

<p>He contented himself for all answer with a
shake of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me, speak to me. What ails you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it is nothing and it is everything,&#8221;
Borgert answered with indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that, George? Talk
sensibly, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to say? I am done with the
whole business. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done! Done with what? How am I to
understand you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done with everything,&mdash;with life and with
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk like a sphinx, George. Why not
tell me frankly what has happened to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My money is gone. I&#8217;ll have to run away,
or else there will be the deuce to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert felt a tremor run through her body.
She did not reply, but turned her face slowly
away from him and stared at the window.</p>

<p>In his heart Borgert was thankful to her for
receiving his communication with such composure,
and not with the screams and hysterical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
sobbings which women habitually employ on
occasions of the kind.</p>

<p>And as he regarded attentively her pale profile,
clear-cut against the light, and saw a tear
glistening in her eye, a passionate emotion,
largely pity for this suffering creature by his
side, so pathetic in her dumb resignation, took
hold of him, and he drew her into his arms.</p>

<p>Then she murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me along, George!&#8221;</p>

<p>In amazement Borgert stared at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, how did you get such
thoughts? How can I do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, George, you do not know. I cannot
bear my life here any longer. Let me go with
you, I beseech you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is not to be dreamt of. Will there
not be scandal enough when I disappear? And
then take you along? Impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case I shall go alone. I must leave
here&mdash;I <i>must</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why all this so suddenly? What has
come to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Leimann gave vent to her suppressed
feelings by a violent fit of sobbing. &#8220;My husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
has beaten me with his clenched fist&mdash;see,
here are the marks!&mdash;because the bailiff
had called on me. His treatment of me has
become worse and worse of late, and now my
hatred, my dislike of him has reached a point
where I can no longer see him around me,
breathe the same air he breathes; and then,&mdash;another
thing,&#8221; and here she broke into
weeping again, &#8220;I have no money&mdash;there is
nothing with which I can pay my debts; something&mdash;some
great misfortune will come&mdash;I&#8217;m
sure of it, George, if I do not leave him
peaceably.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert had great pains to quiet the excited
woman.</p>

<p>He reflected. After all, her idea was not
such a bad one. If she really had made up her
mind fully to leave her husband, she might as
well go with him; for in that case he would
at least have somebody by his side to whom he
could speak, to whom he could open his heart,&mdash;somebody
who would be in the same situation
as himself. And when Frau Leimann once
more implored him with a tearful voice, he
whispered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Then come with me. We shall leave to-morrow
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>They began to make plans, and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us talk this matter over sensibly. First,
how will you get away from here without being
observed by your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is leaving for Berlin to-morrow morning.
He has official matters to attend to there.
Has he not yet told you about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but this is excellent. And now, have
you some money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I received this morning three hundred
marks from my mother, and I have not touched
the money because I had resolved on this step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are better off than I am, at least
for the moment; but I shall raise some money.
And third, how will you get your luggage to
the station? for, of course, I cannot expect you
to run away without some clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very simply, George; just ask my husband
to lend you his big trunk, and tell him you are
obliged to go home on a short leave. I will pack
all my things into that, and the orderly will
bring it down to you here. The trunk is big
enough to hold enough for us both.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is again,&#8221; laughingly said Borgert.
&#8220;Women are best for all underhanded work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And by which train shall we leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will go by the afternoon train, for we
will not leave together; that would attract too
much attention. I shall follow you on the evening
train. I think it will be best to meet in
Frankfort. We will meet in the waiting-room
of the main station, and there we can talk over
everything in quiet. I shall take a three days&#8217;
leave, so that they will not follow me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we are agreed so far. I will come
down here to-morrow forenoon, as soon as my
husband has left, and then we can talk this
matter over a little more in detail. Just now
I&#8217;ll have to leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Leimann turned towards the door.
When she sent a parting nod from the threshold,
she seemed once more enticing in his eyes.
The heated face was animated, and the glowing
eyes radiated life. Truly, she was charming.
Borgert lost himself in pleasant speculations
about the honeyed existence which they two
were to lead hereafter, once that inconvenient
husband was out of the way, and all scruples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
which still clung to them, as the last vestiges
of respectability, had been thrown overboard.</p>

<p>Borgert had regained all his good humor; he
felt almost buoyant, and as if he could dare
undertake anything. There was another consideration
with him. His flight, his desertion,
his leaving his creditors unsatisfied, and a
record of somewhat crooked financial transactions
behind him,&mdash;all that would now be regarded
by people in a wholly different light.
The romantic element would predominate in
the minds of all the gossips. They would say
that these two had fled, because of an overmastering
passion,&mdash;to become united, when unfortunate
circumstances did not permit them
to belong to each other in their present plight.
There would, of course, be enough scandal even
now, but the whole story was going to be lifted
by this elopement into a higher sphere; it would
take on, so to speak, an appearance vastly more
interesting, less vulgar, nay, even aristocratic
and excusable,&mdash;an entirely different matter
from the bald statement that he, Borgert, had
deserted for no other reason except a lot of
bad debts and unclean financial machinations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment, it is true, his better conscience
spoke, reproaching him with the intention of
adding a new crime to his list of old ones; but
this warning resounded so weakly within him
that it had not the slightest effect. The principal
thing, after all, was that he must not let
such an advantage escape him simply to save
the feelings of others. Such minor considerations
could not be allowed to interfere with his
plans.</p>

<p>Borgert therefore briskly walked to town, and
at the post-office, where the telegraph bureau
was located, he wired to a large second-hand
dealer in the neighboring city, telling him to
pay him a visit the following morning.</p>

<p>Then he returned home and stepped up to
Leimann&#8217;s.</p>

<p>He found his friend busy packing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hear you are to start to-morrow. I
only learned it this noon,&#8221; said Borgert, shaking
hands with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I am not at all charmed with the
prospect of this trip, for I had made no arrangements
for it; but you know how it is. It
is always only at the last moment we receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
orders of that kind, often barely leaving us time
enough to reach the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, I envy you your trip. As for
me, there is a less agreeable one awaiting me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, you are also planning a journey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a matter of choice with me; I
simply have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home, starting to-morrow afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see. Well, I wish you luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. By the way, could you lend me a
trunk? I should like to take a number of things
with me home, and my own trunk is too small.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly; my servant will bring you
down the large trunk. I suppose that will answer
your purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course; it will do very nicely.
Thanks again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert could not help perceiving that his
visit did not come quite opportunely. Leimann
was in an ugly humor and did not let himself
be interrupted in his occupation. He was so
much engrossed with his own thoughts that the
import of Borgert&#8217;s questions scarcely reached
him, and the latter deemed it therefore wise to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
remain no longer. He made the promise, however,
to join the Leimanns at their evening
meal.</p>

<p>Reaching his own room again, Borgert felt
himself free of a great burden. In his heart
he rejoiced at the sudden turn his affairs had
taken. The bother and vexation of uncertainty
no longer weighed on his mind. &#8220;The die is
cast!&#8221; he mumbled to himself. He would have
liked to dance and scream for joy. Another
day only, and he would be rid of the whole
sorry outfit, and there would be no further occasion
to worry. And with that, such a pretty
travelling companion! He really wondered at
himself now that this idea had not come to him
sooner.</p>

<p>Suddenly it crossed his mind that he had not
yet begun to pack. At least he should at once
proceed to preliminaries,&mdash;arranging and putting
aside things, and making ready for packing
the more important objects which he meant
to take along.</p>

<p>But what was worth while taking? That
was the question. He began to pick out things.
From over the sofa he took the large silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
goblet&mdash;the farewell gift from his former regiment&mdash;and
placed it in an adjoining room on
the table.</p>

<p>Rapidly, then, he made his selections: an album
of family portraits; sundry packages of letters;
a couple of riding-whips and crops possessing
an intrinsic value,&mdash;that is, a metallic one; two
of the smaller and more valuable oil paintings;
and a large bundle of letters,&mdash;these, besides
some indispensable clothes, were all he intended
to take with him.</p>

<p>When he entered the door at Leimann&#8217;s at
seven, he found them already at table.</p>

<p>Leimann&#8217;s face wore a black look, and he
hardly lifted his eyes to his guest as Borgert
entered.</p>

<p>His wife sat opposite to him, her eyes red
and swollen with recent weeping. She did
not touch the food before her, but every little
while cast a searching and anxious look at her
husband.</p>

<p>Throughout the evening harmony was not
restored; not even a bottle of Eckel succeeded
in bringing gaiety back into this small circle.
Leimann remained in an ugly mood, and whenever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
that seized him nothing could be done with
him. Therefore the parting took place at an
early hour, and it was cooler than it had been
on similar occasions.</p>

<hr />

<p>Next morning Borgert had just risen when
the second-hand dealer arrived.</p>

<p>The officer saluted him pleasantly and bade
him enter. Then he completed his toilet and
began negotiations with the Hebrew merchant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you, please, take the trouble to examine
the furniture and all the other equipments
in these apartments?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I mean
to sell all of it, just as it stands, since I have
been transferred to another garrison. But as
to this point&mdash;I mean my transference&mdash;I
must beg to preserve silence for the moment,
as it is not yet generally known. How much
could you offer me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Jew pensively let his keen eyes wander
all about the dwelling, mentally going through
a rapid process of addition, subtraction, and
silence. Then he proceeded to a more minute
examination. He handled every single piece,
using his knuckles to ascertain its exact condition;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
he subjected hangings, rugs, and carpets,
as well as the expensive carving of the book-cases
and stands, to a similar process. Then he
drew forth a small note-book, greasy and worn,
and squinted at each single object as he noted
down its price. Finally he turned to Borgert
and said, with an obsequious smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen hundred marks, Herr First Lieutenant,
counting it out in gold on this table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! fifteen hundred marks?&#8221; and Borgert
gave a snort of disapproval. &#8220;Why, man,
you must be dreaming. I have paid almost ten
thousand marks for the things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, Herr First Lieutenant,&#8221; the Jew said,
shrugging his shoulders in deprecation of such
high figures. &#8220;Old things are not new things,
and you won&#8217;t get any more from anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not enough; that would be giving
the things away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will pay you two thousand marks,
then, but not a penny more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borgert sat down at his desk. He began to
see that there was no time to lose, and that the
man had him at a great disadvantage. Meanwhile
the dealer had his eyes fastened on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
officer&#8217;s face, and wore the same expectant and
obsequious smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, give me the money; you can have
the whole stuff,&#8221; said Borgert, briefly.</p>

<p>With a smile that now broke over his face
until it illuminated every nook and corner of
the parchment-like wrinkles, the Jew drew a
formal document, a bill of sale, from his breast
pocket, stepped up to the desk, and wrote a few
words on it. Then he requested Borgert to
sign it.</p>

<p>After the dealer had left and Borgert had
securely stowed away the purchase price, he felt
that the last hindrance to his flight had now
been removed, for a certain amount of cash was
an indispensable requisite. Then he stepped
into his bed-chamber, where he took from the
clothes-press an elegant travelling suit. The
remainder of his civilian clothes he packed carefully
and compactly in the large trunk which
Leimann meanwhile had sent down. He placed
them next to Frau Leimann&#8217;s finery in the huge
trunk, and on top of them the few other trifles
above enumerated. Then he had the trunk
taken to the station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Leimann meanwhile was on his way to Berlin.
His wife, however, was still very busy,&mdash;burning
up packages of letters which she did not
wish either her husband or her companion to
read, and then put into a handbag a few objects
of the kind which only women cherish, and the
sole value of which lies in the recollections clinging
to them. It is astonishing what resplendent
images a woman can conjure before her inner
vision when in the possession of such faded
flowers, bits of ribbon, and the like.</p>

<p>Lastly came the leave-taking from Bubi, her
little two-year-old son, and this she had fancied
the day before a much harder achievement than
it now turned out. She felt some qualms of
conscience as she now, with a light heart,
without a tear, left behind her her only child,&mdash;left
it motherless, exposed to a future probably
troubled and cheerless.</p>

<p>It was strange, she thought. From the first
moment on she had experienced something like
aversion for this child with the broad nose, the
large mouth, and the small, shifting eyes. When
but a couple of weeks old, the baby had shown
a striking resemblance to his father, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
more the estrangement grew between his parents,
the more dwindled the small remnant of
her mother love. She regarded this tiny human
being, ugly and eternally crying, as solely <i>his</i>
child. It was in this way that the poor little
fellow had spent nearly the whole of his short
existence,&mdash;either in the kitchen or with the
servants, fondled, scolded, and educated by hirelings.
The mother herself frequently had not
seen her child even for a minute a day.</p>

<p>She had the conviction that her husband had
deserved no better treatment at her hands, and
because of that she scarcely gave him a thought
during these last hours spent at her home.
When she boarded, at three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon,
a first-class compartment of the express
train for Frankfort, she did so with a spirit
light and almost gay.</p>

<p>And the same was true of Borgert. He likewise
cast to the winds any slight sentiments of
regret at leaving the garrison, and as the train,
some hours after Frau Leimann&#8217;s departure,
went shrieking and thundering out of the little
station, he felt that he was being carried on to
a brighter future. That was enough for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>When he and Frau Leimann met, late the
same evening, in the dining-room of an elegant
hotel, all their life seemed to lie before them
draped in rosy hue, and no shadows of coming
evils troubled them. After they had ladled their
soup in comfort, and with the appearance of a
fine game pie, for which this hotel is famous
among <i>gourmets</i>, the ex-officer motioned to the
black-frocked waiter with the immaculate shirt
front, and said, curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;A bottle of Mumm, <i>sec!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus these two celebrated the event of their
flight.</p>

<h3>CHANGES IN THE GARRISON</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> flight of First Lieutenant Borgert
could not long remain a secret.</p>

<p>When he did not return at the expiration of
his short leave, and a telegraphic query brought
the answer from his father that he had not seen
him, the assumption began to take shape that
he had tried to escape the consequences of his
misdoings by deserting.</p>

<p>It is true that no one aside from Leimann
had known precisely his bad financial status.
But when the Jewish dealer came to claim
the furniture sold him, and at the same time the
bailiff arrived with the intention of seizing the
very same objects on the strength of a new
process of attachment begun in court, the catastrophe
could no longer be hidden from the
world. Everybody then began to see, detail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
after detail, the whole system of fraud erected
by Borgert, with the passive connivance of his
friend Leimann.</p>

<p>The court ordered that the entire property of
the deserter be placed in legal custody. A term
was fixed when the horde of creditors whom he
had so shamefully deceived were to be adjudged
<i>pro-rata</i> shares of the whole. Advertisements
were inserted in the papers, calling upon all
those having claims against the estate of the
defaulter to come forward. Hundreds of bills
came by mail from all the cities and towns, and
even from the villages surrounding the little
garrison, and the amounts in their totality figured
up to a considerable sum.</p>

<p>Borgert&#8217;s father, too,&mdash;a worthy old gentleman,
broken-hearted at the downfall of his only
son,&mdash;had to appear in court and depose as to
his son&#8217;s past and present misdoings, as far as
he was aware of them. Even that portion of
the estate which, according to the father&#8217;s intentions,
was to fall to his son&#8217;s share at his
father&#8217;s death, was sequestrated by a mandate
of the court and added to the assets left behind
by Borgert. In addition, the state&#8217;s attorney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
issued a &#8220;<i>Steckbrief</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> against the ex-officer,
in which he was charged with a whole list of
offences.</p>

<p>The dwelling itself had the court seals attached
to it, and even the poor horses in the
stable had fastened to their manes small, leaden
seals tied on with string, to denote that the
state had taken possession of them.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that all these interesting
events travelled through the little town on the
wings of gossip, and no village or city within a
radius of ten miles failed to regard the matter as
a delicious bit of local scandal. The small penny
sheets printed in a number of these places were in
clover. Nothing like such a genuine sensation
had come to their hands for some time.</p>

<p>Colonel von Kronau, the pompous and infallible,
was very much cast down. There were
some smart gentlemen in the regiment who
now claimed to have suspected the facts for a
long time, and to have seen such a catastrophe
approaching. But there are always such people,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>and as a matter-of-fact neither these wiseacres
nor their less astute comrades had ever expected
Borgert to turn out badly. For his case, although
somewhat worse, was substantially the
epitome of their own cases, and it is a truism
that we never see ourselves as others see us.</p>

<p>The colonel remarked to Captain K&ouml;nig, shaking
his head with a melancholy smile, that this
new turn of affairs was the &#8220;last nail in his
coffin,&#8221; and henceforth he was seen going about
with a face gloomy and expectant of the worst.
For gradually he came to the conclusion that
to keep in good order a garrison and its corps
of officers, some other methods must be employed
than those to which he had clung, at the
advice of Frau Stark, for years. It dawned on
him that his type of discipline had wrought a
train of evils which had grown avalanche-like,
and which now at last was likely to bury his
official head under a load of opprobrium.</p>

<p>The fact that Frau Leimann had followed
the First Lieutenant became known a few days
later. This was when her husband returned
from Berlin and found a letter from her, in
which she implored his forgiveness, and assured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
him she had acted under an impulse too
strong to resist. Of their unhappy married life
she said nothing.</p>

<p>Thus Leimann was punished doubly. He had
been made ridiculous before the world, and was
laughed at behind his back by all those who
belonged to his extensive circle of acquaintances.
And Borgert&#8217;s flight had precipitated Leimann&#8217;s
own financial downfall. His creditors and those
of Borgert obtained orders in court which forced
him to sell the larger part of his small private
fortune, consisting of sound investments, to satisfy
their claims. A goodly proportion of his
enforced payments was for those sums guaranteed
by him in Borgert&#8217;s behalf. When all
his affairs had been unravelled, he had but a
very small sum remaining to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile no trace of Frau Leimann and of
her companion was found, although detectives
of various countries were several times on their
tracks. Nobody knew where they had found a
refuge.</p>

<hr />

<p>A fortnight after his desertion poor R&ouml;se was
discovered and arrested. He had been seized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at the Belgian frontier. A court-martial was
quickly summoned, and during the trial it became
apparent that the motive which alone had
driven him to desertion had been the brutal
maltreatment to which his master, Borgert, had
subjected him. The court regarded that, however,
as a mitigating circumstance of such slight
value that it reduced the measure of the punishment
meted out to him in only a small degree.
The poor fellow was universally commiserated
by high and low, and even among the officers a
voice was raised now and then in exculpation.
Many of their subordinates expressed privately
the opinion that a poor soldier, even if only the
son of an humble peasant, like R&ouml;se, ought to
have some rights, and that he ought to be
treated humanely by his superiors. But these
were but private opinions, stated in a barely
audible voice, and in the seclusion of the men&#8217;s
own quarters. As such, naturally, they had not
the slightest value in changing the fortunes of
poor R&ouml;se, who was sentenced to undergo a
term of many years of hard labor in a military
penitentiary.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the divorce trial, which took place at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Leimann&#8217;s instance, a great many unpalatable
facts were brought to light.</p>

<p>The two servant-maids in his house, as well
as the orderly, gave testimony of such a character
that the few remaining hairs on Leimann&#8217;s
pear-shaped skull rose in affright. He could
not understand how he had been so blind as not
to have perceived the treachery of his friend
and the faithlessness of his wife. A decree of
divorce was pronounced by the court, and Leimann
shortly after handed in his resignation.
He was forced to that step by several considerations.
On the one hand he was compelled to
turn to a more profitable calling than that of
serving his country in the army, since he had
now but very slender means at his command;
on the other hand, all the events in which he had
been a conspicuous figure had damaged his reputation
so greatly as to make his further stay in
the corps of officers almost impossible.</p>

<p>He accepted a position for which he was eminently
qualified by natural taste and long experience,&mdash;that
of drummer for a wholesale wine
firm. His little boy he intrusted to the care of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
some humble relatives, and his pension as First
Lieutenant was just sufficient to pay for the
little fellow&#8217;s board.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously, with the acceptance
of Leimann&#8217;s resignation, formal sentence was
pronounced against Borgert. He was condemned
to a jail term of five years, to deprivation
of all civic honors for ten years, and to
expulsion from the army, brought about by a
series of frauds, by desertion and by maltreatment
of subordinates in ten cases.</p>

<p>The newspapers published this sentence, and
with it came to a close the career of this miscreant,
as far as the army was concerned.</p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile there sat in the bureau of a large
factory ex-Sergeant Schmitz, busy at his desk
with a row of figures.</p>

<p>The other employees had already risen from
their places and were taking their overcoats
from a rack in the corner, for the large factory
bell announcing the close of the day&#8217;s labor had
rung out ten minutes since.</p>

<p>But Schmitz did not allow himself to be disturbed
by the loud conversation going on about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
him. He continued writing as if he were in
the midst of silence. The large office-room
had almost emptied itself of its inmates when
Master Worker Maurer entered.</p>

<p>Maurer was a squat-built man, and his pale,
oval face was strangely illuminated by piercing
eyes of a forbidding expression. His moustache
hung straggling about the corners of his mouth,
and there was something indicative of cruelty
and meanness about his whole face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you can&#8217;t tear yourself away from
your work again? Aren&#8217;t you coming soon?&#8221;
he called over to Schmitz. But the latter did
not even look up from his work, and briefly
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;In a moment; sit down!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men were good friends.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks before Schmitz had stood
amidst the mechanics at the lathe, pushing mechanically
one cube of wood after the other
into the sharp teeth of the rotating steel. This
sort of activity had permitted him to indulge
in his own thoughts, for it did not require
him to expend his intellect as well as his
brawn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>But in a short while qualities had been detected
in the quiet, diligent workingman which
brought him advancement. His military training
and the self-sufficing determination which
he had acquired in dealing with raw recruits
had given him a knack of controlling his fellow-workers.
Thus it came about that Schmitz was
promoted to the position of overseer in the
machine hall, the same in which he had so
far toiled with the rest. His fellow-workers,
of course, looked with envy upon this <i>parvenu</i>,
who had only recently appeared among them
and who now played the part of commander.
There was no dearth of scornful remarks at his
expense, but the old soldier understood very
well how to baffle such behavior.</p>

<p>In the morning, after he had seen his men
busily at work at their various tasks, he frequently
paid a visit to Maurer, who was employed
as an engineer.</p>

<p>And during these matutinal chats Maurer discovered
in Schmitz a man whom it would be
easy to gain for his cause,&mdash;the cause of Socialism.
Maurer himself was one of the most
notorious local leaders of the Socialist hosts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and he felt sure that this new man would become
a valuable addition to the ranks of the
forces acting under his supervision.</p>

<p>In this assumption, indeed, Maurer was not
mistaken. Schmitz was still harboring the
hatred against militarism and the government,
which had been engendered in him by his own
experience in the army. A deep-seated, grim
feeling fermented in his soul because of the
bitter injustice done him. He could not forget
that the best years of his life had been frittered
away in a service which in the end proved of
no avail to him. Thus, he had become a recruit
for the Socialist cause, and it had scarcely
needed the persuasions of his new comrade,
Maurer, to induce him to forswear all allegiance
to the ancient cause of king and fatherland,
and to vow service with body and soul to
the red flag. The loyal soldier had become a
strong pillar of the Socialist Party. On the
morrow Schmitz was to make a speech before
a large circle of men holding similar views, and
it was for that Maurer was now waiting for
him. He meant to inculcate another lesson or
two in his friend&#8217;s mind, and to talk over with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
him a few important points in the programme
of the evening.</p>

<p>When Schmitz had laid aside his work and
locked up his sheets in the desk,&mdash;sheets on
which the list of names of the men under him
and the respective amounts of work done by
each were marked down,&mdash;he joined Maurer.
Both then walked on in silence through the
narrow lanes towards Maurer&#8217;s dwelling.</p>

<p>At a nearby dramshop they jointly purchased
a jugful of beer; then took it home, lit the
lamp, and began their conversation.</p>

<p>It turned particularly on a new tax bill,
which would add another serious burden to
those under which the working classes were
groaning. The aim was to gain as many opponents
to it as possible, so that at the last
reading in the Reichstag an overwhelming
majority could be secured against the measure,
sufficient to bring about its defeat.</p>

<p>The two friends were engaged in eager discussion
until after midnight. When they parted
they had reached perfect agreement.</p>

<p>On the day following Schmitz was in a state
of feverish agitation. It seemed strange to him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
after all. But a short while ago he was wearing
the &#8220;king&#8217;s coat.&#8221; A short twelvemonth
previously he had been a soldier of the Kaiser&#8217;s,&mdash;a
man sworn to defend the fatherland and to
aid and further its interests,&mdash;and to-day?&mdash;to-day
he was one of those who are accused of
shaking the foundations of the state edifice, those
who are aiming to erect a new commonwealth
more in consonance with their own ideas and
interests.</p>

<p>But when he on the same evening ascended
the speaker&#8217;s stand, carrying himself erect as a
freeman, and when a crowd of many hundreds
welcomed the new comrade with enthusiastic
shouts, he felt differently. Even before he had
said a word to his new friends they saluted him
joyously as one of themselves,&mdash;as one to bring
about the new millennium,&mdash;and his confidence
in himself grew apace, and a mighty longing to
achieve fame in this <i>new</i> army clutched his soul.
It was his full intention to please this heterogeneous
mass of men; he meant to force them into
the circle of his own conceptions and beliefs, so
that all of them should follow him, without a will
of their own, as sheep follow a shepherd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>And he began his address. He first described
the provisions of this new bill, and then laid
bare the consequences to the laboring multitude
that the adoption of such a measure would
have.</p>

<p>A new tax, he explained, meant a further
step in the pauperization of the masses. He
showed that this new tax was a superfluity,
provided the attempt was abandoned by the
government to increase still further the strength
of the army.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gigantic sums of money are annually wasted
by the government for the military,&#8221; said he, in
a ringing voice. &#8220;Scarcely have millions upon
millions been voted for the introduction of new
rifles and new guns; scarcely have new regiments
been formed and the conformation of
existing ones altered, when all these measures
are found to be worse than useless. Errors of
calculation are discovered when it is too late to
retrieve them, and new sums of enormous size
are demanded in order to overcome innovations
conceived in haste and executed without
judgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Germany&#8217;s reputation and her power in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
world have been won by the army, and it is
her army which neighbors begrudge us. But
have we not arrived on the summit of military
power? Must we extend militarism to the point
where it smothers and throttles all other organs
of the state machine?</p>

<p>&#8220;If we but devoted to other institutions of
the empire a modest portion of the untold money
that is swallowed up every year by the army,
there would be no necessity for laying tax upon
tax upon the citizens until what remains to them
of the fruits of their labor hardly suffices for
bare needs. If we did that, we should be a
wealthy country; the citizen would acquire material
wellbeing. Industry would revive and
yield to the people all its blessings. But if it
is not intended to cease favoring the army to
such an unreasonable extent, let them take the
money needed from the pockets of those who
are spending their days in sloth and wilful
luxury. As it is, the wealthy are not burdened
any more than the poor laborer, while the latter
really has to surrender a portion of the scant
bread he has earned for himself and his family
to maintain a state of things in which capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
enjoys all those advantages which are denied
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I ask of what blessing is the army to
the citizen, to the people as a whole? It takes
away his children; it uses up the best years in
their lives,&mdash;those years in which the youth
ripens into a man, and in which his character
matures. It is during those years that our sons
are often treated with injustice and brutality, and,
as a natural consequence, they return from the
army into work-a-day life, as the bitter enemies
of a government which dismisses many of them
as helpless cripples or as physical wrecks without
ever thinking of making suitable award. Then,
still more frequently, our sons, after spending
the best strength they have in the service of
the state, in hard toil, and in exposing themselves
to all rigors of a changeable climate, are
sent back into the world, dismissed from the
army, just because of some trivial offence,&mdash;kicked
out into the cold as one might a dog,
compelling him to hunt for food and to seek a
new master. Therefore, I say, let us compel
the government to spend hereafter the money
so uselessly wasted for the enlargement of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
army that has already overgrown its proper
size, rather for more useful purposes, so that
the people, the masses, will know what they
have sacrificed themselves for.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words of the speaker, drawn so largely
from his own bitter experiences, were frequently
interrupted by a loud acclaim; but as Schmitz
now stepped down from his eminence to mingle
with his auditors, the large crowd that filled the
hall to suffocation began to rend the air with
frantic cheers. They threw up their caps and
shouted approval; scores of them cried: &#8220;Bravo,
Schmitz!&#8221;; while others crowded up to him to
shake him by the hand. It was an ovation as
enthusiastic as Schmitz had never aspired to in
his boldest moments, and his natural vanity felt
intensely gratified. As to these people, he had
indeed gained them over to his way of thinking.</p>

<p>His words had sounded so convincing, they
had struck the popular chord so accurately, that
many a one in this dense throng who had merely
come that night as a spectator, drawn by idle
curiosity, had been convinced of the justice of
the Socialist cause, and resolved to join the
party which espoused the claims of the poor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>And so Schmitz had that night become not
only an adherent but a leader of the &#8220;red&#8221;
party,&mdash;a party which in this large manufacturing
town was becoming more and more
formidable.</p>

<h3>RESIGNATIONS ARE IN ORDER</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ergeant-Major Krohn</span>, the regimental
chief clerk, was leaning against
the iron railing which shut off from the vulgar
civilian world the edifice holding the offices and
administrative bureaux.</p>

<p>He was smoking his morning cigar with considerable
zest and reading the <i>Deutsche Zeitung</i>,
which the letter-carrier had just left for the
colonel. He was at leisure just then, for the
colonel had gone on horseback to view the regimental
drill on the parade grounds, quite a distance
from town; and on such days it was the
habit of the adjutant to recompense himself by
a sound matutinal slumber for the nightly sleep
he had missed in attending this banquet or that
carousal.</p>

<p>Krohn was deep in the study of the advertisements
he had found in the paper when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
his &#8220;colleague,&#8221; Sergeant-Major Sch&ouml;nemann,
stepped up to him, dragging his clanking sabre
at his heels, and with a cigarette between his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning, morning, Herr Commander!&#8221; he
addressed Krohn in a jocular spirit. &#8220;What is
the news?&#8221;</p>

<p>The minor dignitary thus addressed smiled
pleasantly, and sent a small cloud of fragrant
smoke into the air before answering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great things are going on, noble brother-in-arms.
I had almost forgotten about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! Has H.&nbsp;M. at last sent me
a decoration?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not precisely, but something almost as
unlikely,&mdash;K&ouml;nig has been placed under
arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? K&ouml;nig? Thunder and lightning!
What the dickens has he been doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they say he has been putting his
fingers into the squadron fund, and that some
of the gold has stuck to them. Really, it&#8217;s a
disgrace; a fellow like him, too, quite wealthy,
and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil! I should never have supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that of him; no, not of <i>him</i>! And how did
they find it out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t the faintest idea. I presume the
colonel must have heard something about it.
Yesterday afternoon he had him up in his room
and charged him with the thing to his face. I
peeped through the key-hole, and saw the poor
fellow becoming pale under the accusation. He
wanted to fetch his books at once; but the
colonel wouldn&#8217;t listen to him, and ordered him
forthwith under arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But these two used to get along so well
together!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! And I presume there must be
some truth to the story, else the colonel would
probably have managed the thing otherwise,
especially as he himself is in disfavor with the
powers that be. This new affair will break his
neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as for me,&#8221; said Sch&ouml;nemann, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe in the story until I see it in print.
K&ouml;nig is not at all that sort of fellow. And
the colonel always flies off the handle and seems
to be glad when he has a chance of showing his
authority. He thinks that is smart!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know, and what&#8217;s more, I don&#8217;t
care.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>The explanation of all this conversation is a
very simple one. We remember that First
Lieutenant Borgert, before seeking fresh fields
for his energy, had made up his mind to get
even with Captain K&ouml;nig for that curt letter in
which the captain had refused to accede to
Leimann&#8217;s request for another large loan.</p>

<p>Misled by the captain&#8217;s own words on a previous
occasion of similar kind, he had taken it
for granted that K&ouml;nig had really been guilty
of diverting some of the moneys under his care
to oblige a needy comrade,&mdash;Borgert himself.
In his vindictiveness he had spared no pains in
the course of his conversations with fellow-officers
at the Casino to spread rumors as to
this alleged fact, magnifying the matter or distorting
its details, as it suited his purpose; and
even after Borgert&#8217;s flight these rumors had
been scattered broadcast by the idle tongue of
gossip. Finally, they had filtered down and
become the theme of general conversation. The
colonel, too, had heard of the matter, and, in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
present condition of extreme nervousness regarding
the reputation of the regiment, that worthy
had deemed it his duty to go to the root of it.</p>

<p>K&ouml;nig himself had had no occasion to clear
himself of all this gathering suspicion, for in
his presence the wagging tongues became mute.
Borgert had maliciously misrepresented K&ouml;nig
so much in his talks with the junior officers as
to create quite a strong feeling against him.
He had stated that K&ouml;nig, although abundantly
able to help some momentarily embarrassed
comrades out of their troubles, had not only
refused point-blank, but had added insult to injury.
Such supposed behavior, since Borgert&#8217;s
tales had found credence, had cost K&ouml;nig the
sympathy of the majority of the officers, and
now that trouble had overtaken him, many of
them rejoiced at the fact. Lieutenant Bleibtreu
would have informed his squadron chief of the
unpleasant rumors circulating, but ill luck would
have it that that faithful junior happened to be
off on leave of absence. He did not correspond
with any of his fellow-officers during his leave,
and knew nothing of the matter until after
K&ouml;nig&#8217;s arrest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only by furnishing an extravagantly
high amount of bail that K&ouml;nig temporarily
regained his liberty, having spent some ten days
in jail meanwhile. By the colonel&#8217;s order he
was then suspended from active duty and compelled
to await the outcome of the accusation
in his own home. At first K&ouml;nig was stunned
by the blow. After fifteen years of active service,
during which he had never been charged
with anything contrary to good morals or manners,
he was now accused of a vulgar crime!
And what was worse, the accusation against
him was entirely based on the irresponsible remarks
of a man who was a moral wreck at the
time he made them, and who had since been
legally condemned as a convicted criminal. It
was nothing less than an outrage, it seemed to
him.</p>

<p>Where was the confidence, the good comradeship,
with which he had formerly met on all
sides? Was it not the duty of his superior, the
colonel, first closely to investigate the circumstances
surrounding an alleged fact which on
its face seemed highly improbable, before formulating
such an accusation likely to ruin his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
reputation in the whole regiment and in the
entire army?</p>

<p>And, indeed, the good captain had sufficient
reason for complaining of the treatment he now
met with. The ground had been well prepared
by the mischievous gossip that had preceded his
arrest, and now he was shunned as would have
been a convicted criminal, an outcast, and the
very children in the street pointed the finger of
scorn at him and his family. Bleibtreu was the
only exception. Firmly convinced of the innocence
of his friend, he did valiant service in
trying to restore the former universal confidence
in K&ouml;nig&#8217;s integrity.</p>

<p>He proved his unshaken belief in the captain
by paying him daily visits, and by spending
every evening with him and his family. He
became the companion of K&ouml;nig&#8217;s solitary
walks; and he even persisted in this after he
had been warned of the consequences by the
colonel, and when his comrades punished him
for his unselfish friendship by likewise ostracising
and assuming a hostile attitude towards
him.</p>

<p>But all these machinations did not hinder the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
young man from doing what he regarded as his
duty. He would have deemed himself a poltroon
if he had abandoned his friend now that
misfortune had overtaken him.</p>

<p>The entire body of non-commissioned officers
of the regiment and the whole rank and file of
it felt deeply indignant at the manner in which
this popular officer was made a scapegoat by the
colonel, and this universal sentiment found its
expression by numerous unofficial calls which
many of the captain&#8217;s subordinates made on
him during his time of tribulation.</p>

<p>The same was true of the civilian circles,
both in the garrison and in the neighboring
city: they all were filled with disgust and aversion
at the conditions created by the stupidity
and stubbornness of Colonel von Kronau. They
testified their sympathy for K&ouml;nig on various
occasions. It was owing to all these mitigating
facts that K&ouml;nig gradually came to view the
future with brighter spectacles, and he consoled
himself with the thought that justice
must triumph in the end; but his patience was
sorely tried in the meanwhile, for the investigation
of his case dragged on a long while. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
it had been a case creating sensational interest,&mdash;a
case of manslaughter or of cruel abuse
of subordinates, perhaps,&mdash;there would have
been more promptness, in order to quiet public
opinion; but his was a case which seemed to
call for no such speedy action. What difference
did it make if he had to wait for months,&mdash;a
prey to misgivings and doubts, and exposed
hourly to malignant talk of busybodies?</p>

<p>Six weeks had elapsed before his first preliminary
hearing took place. K&ouml;nig, of course,
took occasion to explain the whole matter, and
to prove, by means of his ledgers and by oral
testimony, how entirely unjust was the accusation
against him.</p>

<p>He was soon undeceived, however, in the
hope that the end of the proceedings against
him had now come; for the court was by no
means satisfied with his <i>ex-parte</i> showing. They
demanded an expert examination of his ledgers
for the last three years, and this task required
fully three months.</p>

<p>At the trial his innocence of the charge was,
of course, fully established, and an acquittal was
the result.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been proven that there had been no
diversion of funds, but that the captain&#8217;s equivocal
statement to that effect made to Borgert
and admitted by the captain himself had been
a mere pretext. The motive for this had also
been shown to be that, as may be remembered,
of preventing further requests for loans from
so bad a debtor as Borgert. A bald statement
of these facts was contained in the finding of
the court-martial.</p>

<p>K&ouml;nig had expected no other finding; but
in the officers&#8217; circle the acquittal called forth
nothing but disappointment.</p>

<p>Some four months later H.&nbsp;M.&#8217;s confirmation
of the court&#8217;s finding reached the little garrison.
And that was the signal for another
procedure, for now it became the duty of the
Council of Honor to undertake a new investigation
of the same facts, but from a different point
of view,&mdash;namely, whether K&ouml;nig had failed in
any one point against the professional honor of
an officer, and hence merited reprimand or punishment
at the hands of his second judges.</p>

<p>The captain accepted this new ordeal with
the long-suffering patience which had become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
habitual to him by this time. The final issue
was still involved in slight doubt, but he felt
himself safe in the firm conviction of his own
innocence.</p>

<p>During this whole period of anxiety his
domestic hearth had been almost his sole source
of comfort. His family life had always been
one of unalloyed happiness, and his wife, though
young and pretty, had never been fond of that
ceaseless round of noisy dissipation which had
been such a feature of the little garrison for
years past. So she did not miss the social
pleasures which she now perforce had to deny
herself; for, along with her husband, the ladies
of the garrison now made it their business to
cut her whenever she met any of them in the
streets. Nevertheless, Frau Clara had felt this
whole time of trial quite severely. A loving
wife is jealous of her husband&#8217;s reputation and
of the honor due him, and, as for herself, she
had been degraded from being the most popular
woman in the regiment to the level of a social
outcast; but her proud soul refused to submit
to this ostracism, and it was no small gratification
to her that the wives of the leading civilians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
made it a point to visit her at frequent intervals,
and with some ostentation. Meanwhile
Lieutenant Bleibtreu, the ever-faithful, was no
less zealous in his attendance.</p>

<p>One evening he again called, but his face was
clouded. It was known to the K&ouml;nigs that the
unpleasant position into which their steadfast
young friend had fallen by championing his
captain&#8217;s cause weighed considerably on him,
and that he had made efforts for some time to
be transferred somewhere else.</p>

<p>As to the cause of his depressed mood, the
lieutenant answered that his petition for transference
had been rejected.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you mean to do now?&#8221; said
his late chief, after a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have handed in my resignation.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment his hosts looked at him in
some consternation, but then K&ouml;nig reached out
his hand and said to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done well. I must confess I pity
you from my heart that you have to leave so
fine a profession, and to inure yourself to prosaic
civilian life, with its eternal questions of
losses and gains; but I understand the motives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which have induced you to take this step. You,
as a young officer, have seen events in this place
which even I, so much older and more experienced
than you, cannot but deplore with all my
heart, and I can well understand it if you have
lost that joyousness in the fulfilment of your
duties which alone often makes these duties
bearable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have wished to have you become a
valued member of another garrison, and to see
other conditions, better than those prevailing
here. That would have proven to you that there
are still many of the officers in our army who
differ radically from some of those with whom
we are acquainted here; but since they deny
you that boon, it is perhaps best for you to
turn your back on the army entirely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I myself would have counselled you in this
sense if I had not felt a delicacy in urging you
to a decision which you might perhaps later
regret; and to show you that I speak with
deep conviction, I will tell you that I myself
am seriously considering my resignation.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time it was Bleibtreu who opened his
eyes in astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But why so?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I understand
your request for transference has been
granted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; but it is with me as with you: my
respect is gone for the profession to which I
have belonged with honor for fifteen years.
The conditions I have found in the corps of
officers here have shown me that I do not belong
here by rights. And who can tell me that
I shall not find similar conditions in my next
garrison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are seeing things too black, Herr Captain,&#8221;
said Bleibtreu.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; continued K&ouml;nig. &#8220;For nine
years I have been vegetating in this miserable
hole. During that time I have lost the natural
gaiety of my disposition. I have lost, or almost
lost, the manners of good society. If I ever get
into better society again, I shall hardly know how
to behave myself. I have become a boor, and
the comrades in Berlin or Hanover would treat
me with perfect disdain if I should venture to
approach them on a footing of equality. The
tone prevalent in our Casino is enough to demoralize
almost anybody in the long run.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right, Herr Captain,&#8221; interjected
Bleibtreu. &#8220;That is the worst of these
little garrisons, especially those located near the
frontier. After living in one of them for a
number of years, one becomes impossible in
decent society. This continual gossip, these
ceaseless bickerings, are enough to destroy the
temper and, to some extent, the reputation of
an angel. Add to this the fact that all sorts
of men &#8216;with a past&#8217; are stuck into these little
garrisons, and the mischief is done. Every
little while we hear the phrase: &#8216;Punished by
transference to Moerchingen, Lyck,&#8217; and a
whole number of similar holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; K&ouml;nig replied. &#8220;For the most
part, officers who are sent to these frontier garrisons
are relegated there to get rid of them.
But H.&nbsp;M. does not consider the fact that to
place such doubtful elements in large numbers
into that sort of garrison renders them even
more harmful than if they were sent to larger
garrisons, where they would be subjected to the
influence of respectable and well-bred comrades.
That is how so many scandalous affairs happen
amongst the officers near the frontier. If only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the officers had at least an opportunity of cultivating
respectable society and of following a
refined taste, permitting them regular attendance
at good theatres, concerts, and the like!
But unfortunately that is not the case; their
whole social intercourse and their sole diversion
consist in frequenting the Casino. And
what can you expect, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is much truth in what you say,&#8221; put
in Bleibtreu. &#8220;By rights the transference to a
frontier regiment ought to be a distinction,
because there they are closest to the enemy,
and would have the first chance to exercise
their profession and to show the stuff that&#8217;s
in them at the outbreak of a real war. But
to-day that is a mere illusion. Every day the
prospect of a war becomes less, and therefore
the chances of marching against the enemy exist
only on paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>When these two shook hands on parting that
night, it was in a sad state of mind. A couple
of weeks later Bleibtreu&#8217;s resignation had been
accepted, and he doffed his uniform and stepped
out into the life of a plain citizen.</p>

<p>The Council of Honor decided, after many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
delays, that Captain K&ouml;nig deserved censure because
of &#8220;endangering his professional honor.&#8221;
The explanation was added that no officer must
put himself in such a position as to expose
himself to the unfavorable opinion of the
world; and since in the present case this had
been done, it was necessary to point out to
Captain K&ouml;nig that his proceeding at the time
in question had been incorrect and injurious to
his honor as an officer.</p>

<p>K&ouml;nig read this official communication calmly,
while a scornful smile played around his lips;
and on that same night his resignation had been
filed at the regimental headquarters.</p>

<p>The colonel himself was not able to see in
his official capacity this outcome of his foolish
measures. A few weeks previous to the occurrence
just described, he himself had received a
letter; but that came from &#8220;above,&#8221; and it was
enclosed in the fatal &#8220;blue envelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been told in it, in the well-known
diplomatic language employed for such occasions,
that H.&nbsp;M. fully valued his faithful services,
but was unable to avail himself of them
any longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>One fine day a huge furniture van stopped in
front of the fine house at the end of the town,
where the colonel had made his stately home
for so many years, and into its capacious maw
brawny men packed, shoved, and kicked everything
of his household goods that was worth
while transporting to the far-away district near
the borders of Russia, to which the deposed
military autocrat was returning, with the intention
of spending the remainder of his days
amid the peaceful calm of his carrot fields and
haylofts.</p>

<p>When the colonel and his wife took final
leave of the little garrison, there was nobody
at the station to bid him a tearful farewell.
His orderly alone stood on the platform, loaded
down with a dozen handbags and bandboxes
the contents of which the Frau Colonel required
on her long journey eastward. When
the colonel, his wife, and his extensive family
of younger children had bestowed themselves
in the interior of a vast compartment, he leaned
out of the window and handed the orderly a
small coin of the realm. The man looked at it
and then spat in disgust.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all those who in the opening chapter of
this veracious tale had assembled around the
hospitable board of the K&ouml;nigs, barely a handful
remained in &#8220;the little garrison.&#8221; The
weeding-out machine had been set in motion by
H.&nbsp;M.&#8217;s private military cabinet, and lo! this
was the result.</p>

<h3>UNTO THIS LAST</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> is past eight o&#8217;clock of an evening in
December. A hurrying crowd is streaming
on its way homeward through the arteries
of a large and busy city. All the shop doors
everywhere are being closed with a thundering
noise, and the ear is assailed by the rattling of
the iron shutters by which thievish hands are to
be kept out during the night hours. The brilliant
gas jets and the incandescent lights in
the show-windows are turned off in increasing
numbers.</p>

<p>On the asphalt pavement dense throngs of
people weary from their day&#8217;s labor, or else
eager for the pleasures and excitement which
the evening has still in store for them, are pressing
forward at an even trot&mdash;an endless procession
of men and women occupying every
grade in the social scale,&mdash;elegantly attired
women and girls, men dressed in stylish fashion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
others clad poorly and with the dust of their
hard toil still clinging to their garments, and,
mingled with them all, half-grown children,&mdash;boys
and girls, who had been busy at counter
or workshop throughout the day.</p>

<p>It was like a miniature reflection of life itself,&mdash;life
in a large city, with all its toil and its
wealth, its misery and its luxury.</p>

<p>On the pavement cabs and busses rattled past
in endless succession; and elegant carriages,
drawn swiftly by spirited horses and carrying
the princes of trade and of birth, and veiled
ladies, who might be actresses or countesses,
for all one could tell, rolled smoothly along.</p>

<p>Scurrying to and fro in zigzag line, and
emitting those peculiar doleful notes invented
for them, automobiles were mixed up in apparently
inextricable confusion with all this hurly-burly
of vehicles, while the trams clanged their
bells, and passengers stood waiting on the edge
of the sidewalks, desirous of boarding them,
yet afraid to risk their lives in the turmoil and
bustle of the intervening space. All this excitement
of metropolitan life, this feverish haste,
and this pitiless crush, bore the stamp of intense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
work performed in a human ant-hill, where
every one of the countless inmates has to fulfil
his duty unremittingly, so that combined toil
will produce a harmonious whole.</p>

<p>An elegantly attired pair turned the corner
into a poorly lighted side street, and then took
their way along the middle of the road, picking
their steps among all the scraps of paper and
the refuse of every kind that covered it. They
came to a halt before a house the exterior of
which showed it to be inhabited by persons in
straitened circumstances, and then they ascended
the well-worn front steps leading to its main entrance.
The doorkeeper peered out of his little
lodge and merely nodded slightly to the two.
They had come here only a few days before,
after leaving the stylish and expensive Grand
Hotel, and that fact had furnished the man with
food for reflection. They were former First
Lieutenant Borgert and Frau Leimann. They
had turned their steps to the French capital,
in the hope to be there secured against any possible
police persecution, expecting to be able
to earn a living in this city of millions, which
furnishes daily bread to so many.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Their funds had rapidly been exhausted; for
he who has not learned to husband his resources
in the days of plenty will not be able to do so
in the days of dire need.</p>

<p>And so Borgert had been obliged to look
about him for some remunerative occupation.
Hunger is a hard taskmaster, and hard as it
seemed to this man who had been reared and
had lived till then virtually in idleness, he had
now to turn his hands to useful work; but the
employment he had been able to secure had
not lasted long. Without a word of warning,
he had been dismissed as incapable of the work
demanded, and he was just now returning from
a last vain effort to obtain another place. They
mounted the steep stairs and entered their little
room, furnished without regard to even moderate
ideas of comfort, and filled with an air
which in the days gone by Borgert had never
been able to endure.</p>

<p>He threw himself on the narrow sofa with a
cry of despair and covered his face with his
hands, while Frau Leimann cowered before the
grate on a small stool.</p>

<p>With eyes hollow from much weeping and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
many sleepless nights, she gazed into the dying
fire. This was all the warmth which they could
expect that night, for their means were entirely
exhausted.</p>

<p>Both of them kept silence for a while, and
then Borgert spoke. The woman trembled at
the sound of his voice, as if she were awaking
from a fearful dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is to become of us now?&#8221; said
he, very low.</p>

<p>She did not answer him, but continued
to gaze into the faintly glowing coals, and a
tear slowly coursed down her pale, emaciated
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow we shall have to leave this
house, for we are unable to pay, and then no
other refuge is left us but the streets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must work, George,&#8221; replied the woman
in a tear-choked voice, although she tried to infuse
some energy into her tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I not tried?&#8221; replied he, with a
shrug. &#8220;But haven&#8217;t they dismissed me every
time without warning? And besides, there is
no use for my trying again. How can I work?
I&#8217;ve never learned it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But something must be done; we must find
a way out of this,&#8221; Frau Leimann cried out,
and her voice sounded shrill. &#8220;If you intend
to leave me to misery, you ought not to have
enticed me away from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enticed?&#8221; Borgert mimicked her. &#8220;Who
has enticed you? Was it not you who implored
me to let you come with me because you were
unable to endure any longer the life you were
leading with your noble husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did so, you, as a man, ought to have
had enough common-sense to talk me out of
my intention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know what man is able to
talk an idea out of the head of a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not speak this way, George; it is worse
than frivolous. Summon all your courage and
energy and let us see what can be done. There
must be a remedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is!&#8221; retorted Borgert, throwing a
loaded revolver on the crazy table.</p>

<p>A tremor shot through the woman, and for a
moment she leaned against the wall as if ready
to swoon, while her wide-opened eyes stared
with fear at the little instrument, the glittering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
steel of which reflected the glowing embers in
the grate.</p>

<p>&#8220;By all that is sacred,&#8221; her voice came hysterically,
&#8220;are you out of your senses!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; replied Borgert, coolly;
&#8220;it is the only way out of all our difficulties,
and it is not the first time I have had the
thought. Is it not better to put an end to this
dog&#8217;s life than to die by inches in penury and
distress?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Leimann stepped musingly towards the
grate, as if its warmth were needed to drive the
thought of approaching death out of her head
and to pour new life into her trembling limbs.
Her gaze hung fixedly on a faded engraving
which was over the mantel, and which represented
a banquet held by one of the ancient
English kings. With glassy eyes she stared at
this picture representing the joys of living.
She did not notice that Borgert had followed
her with his feline step.</p>

<p>The report of his pistol was heard, quick and
sharp, and with a dying moan the woman sank
to her knees. Her left hand felt for the warming
flame, as if searching for its aid, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
tiny bluish tongues of fire wavered in their
reflection on the surface of this white, plump
hand from which a rill of life-blood was slowly
running, drop by drop, into the ashes of the
grate. For a moment only her slayer gazed
terror-stricken at the lifeless body; then he
pointed the weapon at himself, and a second
shot put an end to his existence. Death
squared with his mighty hand all the guilt
and all the debts he had contracted during
his riotous life.</p>

<p>When the two corpses, four days later, were
carted to the cemetery of Bagneux, the Potter&#8217;s
Field of Paris, and there consigned to the common
grave of the destitute, nobody knew and
nobody cared who these two unknown strangers
had been. Nobody suspected the drama of their
lives or the sin which had hurried them to
death.</p>
